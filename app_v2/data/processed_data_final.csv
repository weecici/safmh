1nrq1fs,1758961988.0,2025-09-27 08:33:08,"A school in Tay Ninh doesn't have a physics or chemistry class, so what happens if someone wants to take the A00 exam? I am a 10th grade student in Tay Ninh. As soon as I entered the school, I was very shocked because this school does not have any classes that have both physics and chemistry, but separate 2 classes, this is the most basic block, many majors are accepted and many people choose it, but this school doesn't have it?

As far as I know, ""according to the 2018 general education program, when registering for optional exams, students must choose a maximum of 2 subjects among the selected subjects and have academic results in grade 12; choose the right subjects according to their wishes for the high school graduation exam and admission to universities and colleges. They cannot choose exam subjects that they did not study in grade 12."" That means if I keep studying like that, I won't be able to take the exam, will it block my future career? :((

I also want to be educated like everyone else, I also have equal educational opportunities. It's my future, why doesn't anyone at school help me?
I asked the principal and vice principal but no one could solve the problem. After meeting the principal 3 times, exactly 3 times he asked to see the vice principal and the vice principal asked me to choose another grade???

Next is the shifting of responsibility: I called the department and asked the department, but the department said they didn't know, then asked me to call the office manager. When I called him, he said ""this is my legitimate wish, I will tell the leader to ask the school side"" but after a week I still haven't heard anything. After that, I wrote an application to the principal, he wrote in the form ""transfer to the vice principal to resolve and then sign and seal the school."" The next day, I gave the application to the vice principal, thinking it was resolved, he called me. Writing a transfer application was not the solution as I thought. I was afraid so I said ""let me go home and think more"". After returning home, I called the head office of the department and he asked me to call another person. As soon as that other person called, he turned off the phone. I called another number of the department and the other girl answered that she didn't know. Call me to call teacher V. When I called teacher V, teacher V called the principal 🙂but like you said, the principal didn't solve the problem.

Is the 2018 general education program optimal yet? :((( When you leave a hole like that, and can't find a way to fix it, in the end, the loser is a student like me and has to pay with his future.

I would like to ask if there is any solution for me to not have to transfer schools but still be able to take the A00 exam in the future. Thank you very much everyone.","MỘT TRƯỜNG HỌC Ở TÂY NINH KHÔNG CÓ LỚP TOÁN LÝ HOÁ, rồi ai muốn thi A00 thì sao ? Em là 1 học sinh lớp 10 ở Tây Ninh, vừa vào trường em rất sốc vì trường này không có lớp nào có cả 2 môn lý và hoá mà tách riêng biệt ra 2 lớp, đây là khối cơ bản nhất, xét tuyển rất nhiều ngành và rất nhiều người chọn vậy mà trường này lại không có ?

Theo em biết thì"" theo chương trình giáo    Dục phổ thông 2018 việc đăng ký môn thi tự chọn. Các em phải chọn tối đa 2 môn trong số các môn đã lựa chọn và có kết quả học tập ở lớp 12; chọn đúng môn theo nguyện vọng thi tôt nghiệp THPT và xét tuyển ĐH, CĐ.

Em cũng muốn được giáo dục như mọi người mà, em cũng có bình đẳng vì cơ hội học tập mà. Đó là tương lai của em sao không ai trong trường giúp em
Em có hỏi thầy hiệu trưởng, hiệu phó thì không ai giải quyết được vấn đề, gặp thầy hiệu trưởng được 3 lần thì đúng 3 lần đó thầy kêu gặp hiệu phó còn hiệu phó thì kêu em chọn khối khác???

TIẾP THEO LÀ VIỆC ĐÙN ĐẨY TRÁCH NHIỆM: em có điện hỏi sở thì sở kêu không biết rồi kêu em điện anh N bên phòng, điện anh N thì anh bảo “ đây là nguyện vọng chính đáng của em, anh sẽ nói lại lãnh đạo để hỏi phía nhà trường” nhưng 1 tuần rồi vẫn chưa thấy gì sau đó em có viết đơn xin học cho hiệu trưởng thì ổng ghi vào đơn “ chuyển phó hiệu trưởng giải quyết rồi kí tên đóng dấu nhà trường” hôm sau em đưa đơn cho hiệu phó, tưởng được giải quyết thì ổng kêu em viết đơn chuyển trường chứ không phải giải quyết như em nghĩ, em sợ nên nói “ cho em về suy nghĩ thêm”. Sau khi về em điện chánh văn phòng sở thì ổng lại kêu em điện cho ông khác, ông khác đó vừa điện thì ổng tắt máy, điện tiếp cho số khác của sở thì cô kia trả lời không biết kêu em điện thầy V, điện thầy V thì thầy V kêu điện Hiệu trưởng 🙂mà như em nói hiệu trưởng không giải quyết

Chương trình giáo dục phổ thông 2018 vậy mà có tối ưu chưa :((( khi để 1 lỗ hỏng như vậy, và không tìm được cách vá lại, cuối cùng người thiệt là học sinh như em phải trả giá bằng tương lai của mình.

138dd3h,1683269277.0,2023-05-05 06:47:57,"Hello everyone, I just received the results of the ielts exam (academic - on paper) and the score was better than I expected.

aim: 7.5

overall band: 8.0 (listening: 8.5, reading: 7.5, writing: 6.5 :))), speaking: 8.5)

but that's not the important thing, I wrote this post with the desire to share with those who may have the same characteristics as me: **not interested in taking English tests but forced to take the test or test to prepare for something**. and that lack of interest will lead to many behaviors when learning, for example: jump until the last step. Anyone can learn the subjects they love, but if they don't test well, they will be discouraged.

I seriously review and self-study about 4-5 days before the official exam date. **How can I review 4 skills in less than 1 week?**

**1. know how to calculate scores in ielts.**

This step I personally find to be the most important and is often rarely mentioned when learning English. Knowing how to calculate scores and how to round scores for IELTS will help you differentiate and think more clearly about which skills you need to focus on. You can refer to [here - how to calculate scores](https://www.ielts.org/for-organisations/ielts-scoring-in-detail)

**2. Focus on strengths instead of weaknesses.**

There are two directions when preparing for exams: improving weaknesses and upgrading strengths or both. but in the case of short preparation time, doing both seems a bit difficult. I clearly identify my strengths as listening and speaking, and my weaknesses as reading and writing, and indeed, based on the results, I can prove that.

Why is it a strength? Obviously, if there is a weakness, we should focus on it, right? If you read section 1 and know how to calculate ielts scores, you will be able to feel that using your strengths to pull down your weak points will have a higher score than using your weak points to pull down your strong points.

and like someone who is good at something, they will hone the skills they are good at to become more skilled. Just like not being able to catch a fish climbing a tree :))

**3. documents**

Instead of analyzing 4 skills, I find it not very effective because each person will have a different way of cultivating each skill. So let me share the documents I used:

[writing - reading: ielts advantage](https://www.youtube.com/@ieltsadvantage) \-&gt; This channel is really useful because the teacher teaches and guides Ielts by thinking about the problem instead of just solving the problem.

[writing - ielts liz](https://ieltsliz.com/) \-&gt; A website that contains a lot of useful information about ielts, it's a great resource :)) I use it to refer to the ielts writing exam but also read through sample papers and don't pay much attention.

[listening - online tests](https://ieltsonlinetests.com/listening-test-collection) \-&gt; I only use this site to practice Ielts listening skills. If you know of other sites, please share.

speaking - I only did one step: search YouTube for speaking tests with band 9.0 and imagine myself as a candidate. over and over and keep imagining that I will be able to speak exactly like the person who got band 9.0 in that video.

**4. exam date**

I took the exam at the English council so they would prepare a bottle of water for the candidate. You just need to bring your ID or passport depending on when you register. When you arrive, there will be a list of candidates and exam room numbers.

Personal items will be kept in the locker and you can bring the locker key into the exam room.

Calm down and breathe deeply :))) take the exam with the mindset that it is an opportunity even though you are depressed, after all it is an opportunity.

speaking: I put this section separately because on the day of the exam I didn't know if I had to wear a mask during the exam =))) Oh my god, if you can't hear clearly what the questioner is saying, then feel free to ask the examiner, okay?

In the speaking section, there will be very short questions like ""why?"" for your previous answer. Don't worry because I think the examiner asked this question to: want to hear your answer in more detail, it's as simple as that.

in part 3, I was asked a question and in that sentence there was a word I didn't know. The examiner sees this and explains it immediately. You can't ask questions about vocabulary in part 1, but you can in part 3.

**5. luck and spirit**

It sounds absurd, but I believe there is a little bit of luck and faith everywhere. There is a saying in the movie ""The Three Idiots"" that I really like, which is ""everything will be fine (all is well)"" and it sounds a bit cheesy, but I believe it.

I hope that those who are in the process of self-studying and reviewing will achieve the desired results and continue to study English because of its thinking.

If you guys have any questions","Mấu chốt thi IELTS Hello các bác, chả là tôi vừa nhận được kết quả thi IELTS (Học thuật - Trên giấy) và điểm hơn tôi mong đợi.

Aim: 7.5

Overall band: 8.0 (Listening: 8.5, Reading: 7.5, Writing: 6.5 :))), Speaking: 8.5)

Nhưng đó không phải là điều quan trọng, tôi viết post này với mong muốn chia sẻ cho những bác có thể có đặc điểm giống tôi: **không hứng thú thi Tiếng Anh nhưng bắt buộc phải thi hoặc thi để chuẩn bị cho thứ gì đó**. Và cái việc không hứng thú đó sẽ dẫn đến rất nhiều hành vi khi học, ví dụ như: nước đến chân mới nhảy. Các môn học mình yêu thích ai cũng có thể học được, nhưng riêng những bài kiểm tra mình không hảo thì sẽ bị nản.

Tôi nghiêm túc ôn tập và tự học khỏang 4-5 ngày trước ngày thi chính thức, **chưa đến 1 tuần thì làm sao có thể ôn luyện được 4 kĩ năng?**

**1. Biết cách tính điểm trong IELTS.**

Bước này cá nhân tôi thấy là quan trọng nhất và thường ít được nhắc đến mỗi khi học Tiếng Anh. Việc biết cách tính điểm và cách làm tròn điểm của IELTS sẽ giúp các bác phân mạch và tư duy rõ ràng hơn mình cần tập trung vào kĩ năng nào. Các bác có thể tham khảo ở [đây - cách tính điểm](https://www.ielts.org/for-organisations/ielts-scoring-in-detail)

**2. Tập trung vào điểm mạnh thay vì điểm yếu.**

Có hai chiều phái khi luyện thi: Cải thiện điểm yếu và nâng cấp điểm mạnh hoặc cả hai. Nhưng trong trường hợp với thời gian chuẩn bị ngắn thì thực hiện cả hai dường như là hơi khó. Tôi phân rõ điểm mạnh của tôi là nghe-nói, điểm yếu là đọc-viết, và quả thực dựa vào kết quả điểm có thể chứng minh cho điều đó.

Tại sao lại là điểm mạnh, rõ ràng là nếu có yếu thì nên tập trung vào nó chứ? Nếu các bác đọc mục 1 và biết cách tính điểm IELTS thì các bác sẽ có thể cảm nhận được là việc dùng thế mạnh để kéo thế yếu thì tỉ lệ đạt điểm cao hơn sẽ lớn hơn dùng thế yếu để kéo thế mạnh.

Và giống như một người mà giỏi ở lĩnh vực nào đó, họ sẽ trau dồi kĩ năng họ giỏi để trở nên điêu luyện hơn. Cũng giống như việc không thể bắt một con cá leo cây được:))

**3. Tài liệu**

Thay vì phân tích 4 kĩ năng thì tôi thấy nó không hiệu quả cho lắm bởi vì từng bác sẽ có cách trau dồi từng kĩ năng khác nhau. Nên tôi xin phép chia sẻ tài liệu mà tôi đã dùng:

[Writing - Reading: IELTS Advantage](https://www.youtube.com/@Ieltsadvantage) \-&gt; Kênh này thực sự bổ ích vì ông thầy dạy và cho hướng dẫn Ielts bằng cách tư duy đề thay vì chỉ là giải đề.

[Writing - IELTS Liz](https://ieltsliz.com/) \-&gt; Một trang web chứa rất nhiều thông tin hữu ích về IELTS, nguồn tài nguyên luôn ấy:)) Tôi dùng nó để tham khảo đề thi IELTS Writing nhưng cũng là đọc qua những bài mẫu chứ không chú trọng nhiều.

[Listening - Online Tests](https://ieltsonlinetests.com/listening-test-collection) \-&gt; Tôi chỉ dùng đúng cái trang này để luyện IELTS kĩ năng nghe, các bác biết thêm trang khác thì chia sẻ nhé.

Speaking - Tôi chỉ làm đúng 1 bước: search Youtube những bài thi nói có band 9.0 và tưởng tượng như mình là thí sinh. Lặp đi lặp lại và cứ hình dung ra là mình sẽ nói được y như người mà được band 9.0 trong videos ấy.

**4. Ngày thi**

Tôi thi ở Hội Đồng Anh nên họ sẽ chuẩn bị sẵn một chai nước cho thí sinh. Các bác chỉ cần đem căn cước hoặc hộ chiếu tùy vào lúc mình đăng kí. Đến nơi sẽ có danh sách thí sinh và số phòng thi.

Đồ vật dùng cá nhân sẽ được để ở locker và các bác có thể mang chìa khóa locker vào phòng thi.

Bình tĩnh và thở sâu:))) hãy thi với tâm trạng nó là cơ hội mặc dù mình chán nản, dù gì nó cũng là cơ hội.

Speaking: Tôi đặt riêng mục này vì đến ngày thi tôi không biết phải đeo khẩu trang khi thi các bác ạ=))) ối giời ơi nên các bác không nghe rõ người hỏi nói gì thì cứ mạnh dạn hỏi giám khảo nhé,

Trong phần thi nói, sẽ có những câu hỏi rất ngắn kiểu như ""Why?"" cho câu trả lời trước của các bác. Đừng lo lắng vì tôi nghĩ giám khảo hỏi câu này là để: muốn nghe câu trả lời của các bác chi tiết hơn, chỉ đơn giản vậy thôi.

Trong phần 3, thì tôi được hỏi một câu và trong câu đó có từ tôi không biết. Giám khảo thấy vậy nên giải thích ngay lập tức luôn. Phần 1 thì không được thắc mắc từ vựng nhé, nhưng phần 3 thì có thể nha.

**5. May mắn và tinh thần**

Nghe phi lí nhưng tôi tin ở đâu cũng có một chút may mắn và niềm tin. Có một câu nói trong phim ""Ba Chàng Ngốc"" tôi rất thích đó chính là ""Mọi chuyện rồi sẽ ổn thôi (All is well)"" và nó nghe hơi sến, nhưng tôi tin như vậy.

Tôi mong những bác nào đang trong quá trình tự học và ôn luyện sẽ đạt được kết quả mong muốn và hãy cứ học Tiếng Anh vì tư duy của nó nhé.

Nếu các bác có thắc mắc gì hoặc câu hỏi gì thì đừng ngại mà hỏi nha, hoặc không thì cảm ơn các bác đã đọc bài post dài ngoằng này.","hello everyone , i just receive result ielts exam ( academic - paper ) score good than i expect . aim : 7 . 5 overall band : 8 . 0 ( listening : 8 . 5 , reading : 7 . 5 , write : 6 . 5 :))), speaking : 8 . 5 ) that's not important thing , i write post desire share those who may have same characteristic a me : ** not interested take english test force take test test prepare something **. lack interest will lead many behavior when learning , example : jump until last step . anyone can learn subject they love , if they don't test well , they will discourage . i seriously review self - study about 4 - 5 day before official exam date . ** how can i review 4 skill less than 1 week ?** ** 1 . know how calculate score ielts .** step i personally find most important often rarely mention when learn english . know how calculate score how round score ielts will help you differentiate think more clearly about which skill you need focus . you can refer [ here - how calculate score ]( ** 2 . focus strength instead weakness .** there two direction when prepare exam : improving weakness upgrading strength both . case short preparation time , do both seem a bit difficult . i clearly identify my strength a listening speaking , my weakness a reading writing , indeed , base result , i can prove . why a strength ? obviously , if there a weakness , we should focus , right ? if you read section 1 know how calculate ielts score , you will able feel use your strength pull down your weak point will have a high score than use your weak point pull down your strong point . like someone who good something , they will hone skill they good become more skilled . just like not able catch a fish climb a tree :)) ** 3 . document ** instead analyze 4 skill , i find not very effective because each person will have a different way cultivate each skill . let me share document i use : [ write - reading : ielts advantage ]( \-& gt ; channel really useful because teacher teach guide ielts think about problem instead just solve problem .

After graduating, I pondered over whether I should stay in Hanoi to find a job in the right field or not. But in the end, I decided to go to the industrial park to do it mes - a job quite contrary to my major.

The reason is quite simple: when I return to industrial park, I have a job immediately, the basic salary is about 11 million, if overtime it is about 14 million. Meanwhile, in Hanoi it is very difficult to get a job.

However, after 2 months of working, I began to realize a problem: if I continue to stay here, my future will probably only revolve around job hopping between companies in the industrial park, and it will be difficult to move further. Besides, working in an industrial park far from home is also a pressure - later on, there's the matter of getting married, taking care of elderly parents... and obviously I can't work far away forever😀

So I decided to start studying ai, setting a goal that by the end of next year I will return to Hanoi to find new opportunities.
To be honest, I'm not sure if this choice is the right one or not, so I'm writing here to share my story, looking forward to hearing more advice and perspectives from you guys 🥲","Rời Hà Nội vì không tìm được việc, về KCN làm IT MES trái ngành… giờ tôi học AI để quay lại, liệu có khả thi? Tôi một sinh viên CNTT mới ra trường mảng lập trình di động.

Sau khi tốt nghiệp, tôi từng đắn đo mãi có nên ở Hà Nội để tìm việc cho đúng ngành hay không. Nhưng cuối cùng, tôi quyết định về khu công nghiệp làm IT MES – một công việc khá trái với ngành học.

Lý do thì khá đơn giản: về KCN thì tôi có việc ngay, lương cơ bản khoảng 11tr, nếu tăng ca thì tầm 14tr. Trong khi đó, ở Hà Nội xin việc rất khó khăn.

Tuy nhiên, sau 2 tháng làm việc, tôi bắt đầu nhận ra một vấn đề: nếu cứ tiếp tục ở đây thì tương lai có lẽ chỉ quanh quẩn nhảy việc giữa các công ty trong KCN, rất khó để vươn xa hơn. Bên cạnh đó, làm ở KCN xa nhà cũng là một áp lực – sau này còn chuyện lập gia đình, chăm sóc bố mẹ già… và rõ ràng tôi không thể làm ở xa mãi được😀

Vậy nên tôi quyết định bắt đầu học AI, đặt mục tiêu đến cuối năm sau sẽ quay lại Hà Nội tìm cơ hội mới.

Even though I haven't taken the university exam yet, I'm planning to take the exam again next year. I understand what my current score range is. I used to think that I could take any college entrance exam, the important thing was ability, so I didn't study hard for a long time until the end of 12th grade. Recently, I came into contact with a few brothers and sisters and my thinking also changed. I like economics and want to enter Neu, but my current score is quite far from Neu, even though I'm still studying for the exam, I know it's very difficult.   
I want to take the exam again next year but I haven't dared to ask my parents yet. I'm afraid they won't agree and think that if I haven't studied in the past year, this is the result I have to accept. People around my area are very good. If they don't recruit directly, they will study abroad. I'm afraid that if I tell them, my parents will feel embarrassed with neighbors and relatives, so they don't agree.

This is a sentence that I often joke with my 12th grade students when I was still a student at BKU HCM. Partly because for me, at that time (2013), polytechnic university was an option that was not too difficult for me.
So what am I doing now? To be honest, compared to my friends around me, I can be called a loser. Many of my friends who studied at top 2 and top 3 universities now have extremely good jobs in the US, Australia, Singapore, and Japan. Of course, the number is not much compared to those who study at top schools.

The truth is, what does a good school give you:
-Better lecturers, with top PhD professors in the country. But it only really makes sense when you follow in those teachers' footsteps. Still teaching at school? During my time in college, I always failed because self-study was easier to understand than listening to teachers. Of course I still have something called a good degree (it's for nothing).
-better relationships because you will be surrounded by top students, studying in groups, and ""following the example"" better.  -&gt; correct. These relationships are essential later when you are born. But for me, it just feels a little better. In fact, at the lower top schools, or even the four major supplementary schools in HCM, there are many high-class students studying there.
so:
- Don't be afraid if you accidentally fall into a lower top school
- The important thing is that during the 4 years of college, what do you do, how do you self-study, how do you hone your soft skills, and how do you proactively form relationships?
- In whose era did you enter the threshold? A very useful tool to shorten the quality gap between educational environments. Make good use of it. 
again… don't be afraid.","Gửi các bạn trẻ đang lo lắng vì điểm thi đại học “Đậu đại học chỉ quyết định chỗ ngồi chơi game của bạn ở đâu trong vòng 4 năm tới”
Đây là câu mà mình vẫn hay đùa với mấy thằng em lớp 12 khi mình vẫn còn là sinh viên BKU HCM. Một phần là với mình thi thời đó (2013), đại học bách khoa là 1 option không quá khó với sức của mình.
Vậy bây h mình đang ntn? Nói thật so sánh với  bạn bè xung quanh, mình có thể gọi là loser. Không ít những bạn bè mình học trường đại học top2, top3 h đang có những job cực kì đỉnh ở Mỹ, Úc, Sin, Nhật. Đương nhiên là số lượng không nhiều so với những bạn học trường top.

Sự thật là trường xịn đem lại cho bạn những gì:
-giảng viên tốt hơn, với những giáo sư tiến sĩ top đầu cả nước. Nhưng nó chỉ thật sự có ý nghĩa khi bạn theo chân các thầy cô đó. Còn giảng dạy trên trường ư. Suốt thời đại học mình toàn cúp do tự học dễ hiểu hơn là nghe thầy cô dạy. Tất nhiên mình vẫn có cái thứ gọi là bằng giỏi (chả để làm gì)
-mối quan hệ tốt hơn do xung quanh bạn sẽ toàn là sinh viên đỉnh, học nhóm, “noi gương” tốt hơn.  -&gt; đúng. Những mối quan hệ này rất cần sau này khi bạn ra đời. Nhưng với mình thì chỉ cảm giác tốt hơn 1 chút thôi. Thật ra ở các trường top dưới, hoặc ngay cả tứ đại bổ túc hcm, cũng nhiều sinh viên cốp to theo học lắm đấy.
Vậy nên:
- đừng sợ nếu bạn có lỡ rớt vào trường top dươi
- quan trọng là trong 4 năm đh, bạn làm gì, tự học ra sao, tự trau dồi kĩ năng mềm thế nào, chủ động kết giao mối quan hệ ra sao.
- các bạn bước vào ngưỡng đh trong thời đại AI. Thứ công cụ rất hữu ích để rút ngắn khoảng cách chất lượng giữa các môi trường giáo dục. Hãy tận dụng tốt nó.

I'm about to take the university entrance exam, but my current condition is so bad

I don't know if I have a mental problem or I'm just overdoing it

\- My family often says harsh things to me (since I was little, I'm very sensitive). I feel like I'm not loved as much as you, so I always feel sad. When I was in school, I was always able to get into the class and choose to show off to my family, but I was told that ""a blind cat caught a fried fish"" and many other problems that I don't want to repeat anymore.

\-Normally people don't remember much about their childhood memories, but the thing I remember most is when my family told me that when I was pregnant, my mother tried to abort me three times but then kept it (sometimes I was scared so I went home, sometimes when I was older I didn't abort anymore). I guess from that moment on I felt like I wasn't needed by anyone, although I was still loved, but my mother loved me more.

\-Last month, I alone took the competency assessment test in another province (a test that can be used for university admission). When I left, waiting for the car, there were 2 father and son standing next to me. The other friend's father asked her 'can I do my homework - ""I can only get so many points, Dad"" her father replied, ""That's all I need, son"" I heard that sentence and suddenly I cried. I've never heard anyone say something like that to me before.

\-I'm about to have an exam so I'm at home but I always hear harsh sentences and sometimes cursing because I'm lazy and don't know how to work

\-I have insomnia, feel tired but don't feel sleepy

\-I've been crying every day these past few days, thinking about myself right now makes me cry right now, plus being scared because the exam is near adds up to a very uncomfortable feeling.

\-people who are always tired and think negatively

It's also called wanting to complain and I still want to find a way to overcome this situation, at least I want to calm down to finish the exam.","Sắp thi đại học mà có vấn đề về tâm lý \* Bài viết hơi tiêu cực \*

Em sắp thi đại học rồi mà trạng thái hiện tại em đang tệ quá

Em không biết có phải bản thân đang có vấn đề về tâm lý hay chỉ là đang làm quá lên

Hồi đi học em lúc nào cũng thi vào được lớp chọn về khoe gia đình thì bị nói là "" mèo mù gắp phải cá rán à"" và nhiều vấn đề khác em cũng chẳng muốn nhắc lại nữa

\-Thường thì người ta không nhớ nhiều về ký ức hồi nhỏ nhưng chuyện mà em nhớ nhất là lúc được người nhà kể rằng lúc có bầu em mẹ em đã định bỏ 3 lần nhưng sau đó vẫn giữ lại ( lúc thì sợ nên về, lúc thì t.hai lớn r ko phá nữa) chắc từ lúc đó em thấy mình không được ai cần đến tuy vẫn được thương nhưng mẹ thương anh nhiều hơn

\-Tháng trước em một mình đi thi đánh giá năng lực ở tỉnh khác ( 1 bài thi có thể dùng để xét tuyển đại học) lúc ra về đợi xe đứng cạnh em có 2 bố con. Bố bạn kia hỏi bạn ấy là ' Con có làm bài được không- "" con chỉ được ngần nay điểm thôi bố ạ"" bố bạn ấy đáp "" Bố chỉ cần thế thôi con ạ"" em nghe câu đấy xong tự dưng em khóc từ trước đến giờ em chưa bao giờ nghe ai nói với mình câu tương tự thế

\-Sắp thi nên ở nhà mà lúc nào cũng nghe mấy câu nặng nề lúc thì chửi vì lười không biết làm việc

\-Em bị mất ngủ, người thấy mệt nhưng không có cảm giác buồn ngủ

\-Mấy hôm gần đây hôm nào em cũng khóc, tự nghĩ về mình hiện tại là khóc được ngay, thêm việc lo sợ vì gần thi cộng lại nó thành cảm giác rất khó chịu

I'm also very afraid of graduating later so I'm planning on 1, going to a private school for a short time to keep up with the schedule and still be in the right field, 2, that next year the average score at that school will be lower so I'll still retake the final exam (I consulted with the teachers at the school.

My nephew is 4 years old and is very fussy. There are times when he is under pressure and loses focus. While sitting and studying, he plays with me and when he doesn't respond, he screams. I feel helpless and frustrated because of the child.

The reason I have to babysit is because my husband and I are separated, leaving the grandchild to be looked after by my grandparents (my uncle), but my uncle is also busy with housework so he gave it to me to look after.

I told my mother, but out of respect, my mother still forced me to look after my grandchild while I was about to take the exam

In the past, I was so busy playing around that I didn't go to 11th grade. At that time, I was very arrogant, always considered myself right, and many times argued with my parents. I was afraid my parents would know I didn't go to class, so during the first half of the semester I woke up early, went to school as usual, and didn't come home until after school. Because my parents are busy, they don't pay attention to parent-teacher conferences. The peak when I was discovered was that my parents never saw the teacher calling for a class meeting, hadn't paid the tuition, and didn't have a transcript. At that time, my family knew that I had missed half a semester of school.

That day, I was both humiliated and embarrassed. I cried and wanted to confess, so my parents didn't dare to say much. My mother cried and my father fell ill and didn't go to work for 3 days. After that, I went to vocational school to study.

I didn't know what was wrong until these past few days, when I saw my parents struggling, tuition being high, and my peers studying in high school and taking university entrance exams, I felt so stupid. I don't know where my future will go. I used to be addicted to games, a year ago I quit completely.

I am currently preparing for grade 12 and planning to take the block A exam (math - physics - chemistry). I want to ask for experience from those who have previously studied for the high school exam, especially those who are in difficult circumstances or have studied mainly on their own.

Currently I don't have the conditions to go to private school, my parents still haven't let me go to the center. I self-assess my academic ability at a good level (not too weak but not sure to get a high score). I study according to the book program ""connecting knowledge with life"".

From now until the school year, where should I start reviewing?

If I study on my own, what route should I follow? Are there any documents, YouTube channels, or reliable sources to learn from?

Trong 4 năm qua, em không có động lực học + tư duy kém nên em chẳng tích lũy được kiến thức gì cả. Mấy môn tính toán thì em còn học được nhưng động đến code là em lại sợ. Ngoài ra trong 4 năm em ở nhà họ hàng nên không cần phải lo cơm áo gạo tiền, thành ra em cũng chẳng ra ngoài đi làm trải nghiệm. Hè năm nay em may mắn được nhận vào thực tập ở 1 công ty không lương. Khi bắt tay vào làm dự án em không thể code nổi 1 giao diện đơn giản mà chỉ hỏi chatgpt từ A đến Z. Em cảm thấy nếu cứ đi tiếp với tình trạng này thì cũng không thể làm đồ án để ra trường nổi và đã xin bảo lưu (đồng thời em bị chứng rối loạn Tic nên bảo lưu để chữa trị).

At first, our family didn't know, he asked for money to get gas, paid shipping for a few dozen, so we lent it to him, but recently his addiction got worse, he started plugging in all his things, from cccd, icloud, phone to get money. play. 

When my family first found out about it, they helped him redeem his belongings. We reminded him + warned him many times, but then the same thing happened. He started stealing more valuable things: my mother's laptop, and to top it all, he just hacked the motorbike I bought for him to go to school. My family also tried many times to talk to it and even physically interact with it. It also promised that it wouldn't play anymore, but still continued to bring the redeemed items home to plug in. Our family also confiscated all of his belongings, let him use bricks, and let him ride a bike to school, but he borrowed from others and played around, and now owes nearly 50 million. 

My family is not well-off, but it's enough for the two of us to have a full education, and we don't lack anything. My younger brother's college entrance exam is almost a month away, so our family wants to let him finish his exams properly, then send him to the army or somewhere else to work on a family project, but with his situation and attitude like this, I find it increasingly difficult to do anything 😭. I wonder if anyone has any way to help my family or at least reduce the frequency of gambling until he finishes his exams? Thank you for taking the time to read.

Nhà mình cũng nhiều lần thử nói chuyện, thậm chí tác động vật lý với nó, nó cũng hứa hươu hứa vượn là không chơi nữa, nhưng vẫn tiếp tục mang đồ vừa chuộc về đi cắm. Nhà mình cũng đã tịch thu hết đồ của nó, cho xài cục gạch, cho đạp xe đi học, nhưng nó lại đi vay người khác và ra nét chơi, đến giờ nợ cũng gần 50tr. 

Nhà mình cũng không phải khá giả nhưng cũng đủ để 2 anh em ăn học đầy đủ, cũng không thiếu thốn gì, em mình thì còn gần tháng nữa là thi đại học, nên nhà mình cũng muốn cho nó thi xong tử tế, rồi cho nó đi lính hoặc cho vào trong chỗ khác làm 1 cái dự án của gia đình, nhưng mà với tình hình và thái độ của nó thế này mình thấy ngày càng khó làm gì được 😭.

I'm 22 years old (2k2) and just graduated from university with a major in IT, but I don't have any professional knowledge. The thesis in school only helps my group members a little (drag and drop the interface, add data to the database, call the processing API), but I don't know how to code.

I have a shy personality and am not agile. Everyone who meets me says I'm too gentle. My physical strength is also poor, so I'm afraid to do manual work. Now I don't dare to do anything, I just stay in my room and feel quite depressed with an uncertain future. I plan to buy another reactjs course to learn to gain knowledge to apply for an internship, but seeing that the 2 courses I've bought don't have any benefits, it makes me hesitate and don't want to buy anymore. During my internship, I worked as a helpdesk intern but I just helped everyone and didn't dare to do it. I didn't really know how to do it. I wished I knew how to do it so I could stay and apply for an official position, but I couldn't do it.

Em tính mua thêm khoá reactjs khác để học để có kiến thức xin intern nhưng nhìn 2 khoá học em đã mua không được lợi gì khiến em đắn đo và không muốn mua nữa.

When I returned home, I was introduced to an apprentice position at a software company, but the tech stack was completely different from the field of study. I worked for 3 months without pay, and it wasn't suitable, so I quit. Then my acquaintance (high position) joined a private company to do a little work but operate software (not touching much code), offering a trial job of 8 million. Working for 3 months, I found the environment to be quite leisurely, comfortable, and no pressure, but because of that, I didn't learn much and my expertise didn't improve.

I want to share to inspire young people about learning, learning is extremely important, no matter what profession. I still remember the day I studied polytechnic, failing the exam continuously, extremely discouraged. It's just that when I was 22 years old, my friends graduated and went to work, I was living off my parents and couldn't do anything, so I was determined to graduate. The real turning point was probably when I met the instructors who taught me about my thesis and dissertation very enthusiastically. At Polytechnic, presentation skills are very important, and anyway, thanks to that turning point, I have confidently presented in lecture halls many times. Today, after many years of working, although I still lack a lot of accumulated experience, I am no longer afraid of interviews, because I think my knowledge has accumulated, even if I cannot work at this company, it will still work at another company. That confidence comes from studying a lot. I want to share here because I hope young people will always be ready to learn and will be confident in the work they do.

Chỉ là đến năm 22 tuổi, bạn bè ra trường đi làm, mình thì ăn bám cha mẹ và chẳng làm được cái đếch gì, mình quyết tâm học ra trường. Bước ngoặt thực sự chắc là việc mình đã gặp các giáo viên hướng dẫn đã chỉ dạy mình về đồ án, luận văn rất nhiệt tình. Tại Bách Khoa, kỹ năng thuyết trình rất quan trọng, và dù sao thì nhờ bước ngoặt đó, mình đã tự tin thuyết trình tại giảng đường rất nhiều lần. Hôm nay, sau nhiều năm đi làm, kinh nghiệm tích lũy dù còn thiếu nhiều, mình không còn sợ việc phỏng vấn nữa, vì rằng mình nghĩ kiến thức của mình đã tích lũy dù không thể làm việc tại công ty này thì cũng là công ty khác.

The story is that I registered to study IELTS for 2 years from an acquaintance, but it wasn't effective. I just solved the question, didn't make many corrections, and at that time I wasn't able to concentrate, so most of the time I studied without goals and plans. I went to school to maintain that habit. Because next year I will do quite a lot of journal + project + paper, so I studied for ielts for 1 month to take the exam and got 6.0 (1 month of real study). At first I only needed &gt;= 6.0 but now I'm quite worried because:

\- My goal is 3, then 6.0, some people say it's low, I shouldn't put it in my CV, so I write it as can communicate well 😭 I also want to work at momo, nab, vng, ... so I don't know if I should write it down or not and will I be underestimated. My spk is about 5.5 lis 5.0, I'm weak in vocab but my fluency is quite good 😭

Currently I plan to:

1. Improve your speaking skills to communicate better, retake the exam at the end of the year (or not if you pass the intern or speak better)

2. Retake to 6.5 in the next 2 months (as I said, I'm quite busy so I'm quite afraid of this choice 😭 I'm not sure because I have to allocate time for thesis and research and learn more skills)

What do you think should be done? 😭 I sincerely thank you and look forward to receiving your advice.","Ielts và công việc Các anh chị làm bên tech ơi, cho e hỏi 6.0 ielts có nên ghi vào cv kh ạ ?

Chuyện là em có đăng ký học ielts người quen 2 năm, nhưng không hiệu quả ạ, kiểu chỉ lên giải đề th, kh chấm chữa sửa nhiều và thời gian đó e cg không tập trung nên hầu như em học kh có mục tiêu và kế hoạch, e đi học để duy trì thói quen th. Vì năm tới e làm journal + project + paper khá nặng, nên em đã ôn ielts trong 1 tháng để thi và được 6.0 (1 tháng học thật ạ). Bản thân em lúc đầu chỉ cần &gt;= 6.0 nhưng giờ em thấy khá lo vì:

\- goal của em là BA thì 6.0 một số người bảo thấp, không nên bỏ vào cv nên ghi vào là can communicate well thui ạ 😭 Em cũng mong muốn làm ở Momo, nab, vng, … nên e không biết nên ghi hay không và có bị đánh giá thấp không ạ. Em spk khoảng 5.5 lis 5.0 ạ, e bị yếu vocab chứ fluency em khá ổn 😭

Hiện tại em dự định:

1. Nâng skill speaking để communicate tốt hơn, cuối năm thi lại (hoặc không nếu em đậu intern hoặc nói tốt hơn)

2. Retake lên 6.5 trong 2 tháng tới (như e nói em khá bận nên em khá sợ lựa chọn này 😭 kiểu ko chắc chắn vì phải phân bổ thời gian cho đồ án và nghiên cứu và học thêm skill)

Hello everyone, I want to ask about my situation at **Hanoi Polytechnic University**, to see if anyone has ever been in a similar situation or knows how to handle it.

**my information:**

* I enrolled **9/2015** (60th grade).
* already **did and defense thesis to graduate in 2021**.
* However, up to now I have **still not been awarded a degree** because I still owe **1 subject**, and this subject is **at the mechanical institute** (not a subject at the chemistry institute - where I studied).
* I **have never asked for a reservation**, so the study time is counted continuously from 2015 to present.
* As I understand, the maximum study time of the engineering program at BK is about **10 years (twice the standard time)**. I calculate that I have almost reached or exceeded that mark.
* Because the subject I owe is **not physical education or national defense and security**, it is **not eligible to be extended for another 3 years** according to current regulations.

**my question:**

1. Has anyone fallen into the situation of **exceeding the maximum deadline** but **asking to retake the course in only 1 subject** to get a degree?
2. Is there any mechanism such as **applying for reinstatement of study rights**, requesting an exception, or requesting to make up a final subject?
3. When making an application, what documents need to be prepared for the institute/training department/board of directors to review?
4. Especially if anyone studying **chemistry institute** or **mechanical institute** has experience asking for exceptions for similar cases, please give me advice.

I really want to complete my degree after nearly 10 years, so any experience sharing is very valuable to me.

Thanks everyone in advance! 🙏","Có ai từng bị quá hạn tốt nghiệp ở ĐHBK Hà Nội và xin học lại 1 môn chưa? Chào mọi người, mình muốn hỏi về trường hợp của mình tại **Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội**, xem có ai từng rơi vào hoàn cảnh tương tự hoặc biết hướng xử lý không.

**Thông tin của mình:**

* Mình nhập học **9/2015** (K60).
* Đã **làm và bảo vệ đồ án tốt nghiệp năm 2021**.
* Tuy nhiên đến giờ mình **vẫn chưa được cấp bằng** vì còn **nợ 1 môn**, và môn này lại **thuộc Viện Cơ khí** (không phải môn của Viện Hóa – nơi mình theo học).
* Mình **chưa từng xin bảo lưu**, nên thời gian học được tính liên tục từ 2015 đến nay.
* Như mình tìm hiểu, thời gian học tối đa của chương trình kỹ sư ở BK là khoảng **10 năm (gấp 2 lần thời gian chuẩn)**. Tính ra mình gần như đã chạm hoặc vượt mốc đó.
* Vì môn mình nợ **không phải Thể chất hoặc Quốc phòng–An ninh**, nên **không thuộc diện được gia hạn thêm 3 năm** theo quy chế hiện hành.

**Câu hỏi của mình:**

1. Có ai rơi vào trường hợp **đã quá hạn tối đa** nhưng **xin được học lại 1 môn duy nhất** để lấy bằng chưa?
2. Có cơ chế nào kiểu **xin phục hồi quyền học tập**, xin ngoại lệ, hoặc xin học bù 1 môn cuối cùng không?
3. Khi làm đơn, cần chuẩn bị giấy tờ gì để Viện/Phòng đào tạo/ban giám hiệu xem xét?

From the internship not being as expected, to the thesis being assigned to a teacher I didn't like very much, to the fact that I've recently stopped hanging out with some college friends. In addition, I also participated in a number of projects and was also pressured by my peers because everyone was good, at the peak when the project team had 6 people, 5 of them were 5th grade students, while I was just a good student and nothing outstanding. All of the above things have an invisible impact that makes me tired and don't want to do anything. And even though I told myself I need to rest, it's been 2 weeks and I still haven't stabilized and am losing more and more motivation. Can anyone give me some advice?

Ngoài ra em cũng có tham gia một số dự án và cũng bị áp lực đồng trang lứa vì mọi người giỏi, đỉnh điểm khi cả nhóm dự án 6 người thì 5 người sv5t, còn em chỉ là sv khá và không có gì nổi trội. Những thứ trên vô hình chung tác động khiến em bị mệt mỏi không muốn làm gì cả. Và em có tự nhủ chắc mình cần nghỉ ngơi nma đã 2 tuần rồi em vẫn chưa ổn định lại và đang ngày càng mất động lực. Mọi người có thể cho em vài lời khuyên được không ạ?

1dfja93,1718342368.0,2024-06-14 05:19:28,"Falling into bad habits, having difficulty finding one's self, a healthy lifestyle and keeping a constant relationship with everyone Hello everyone in the sub.

I'm 22 years old, I was diagnosed and treated for depression 2 years ago. By August of last year, things got worse, making it difficult for me to return to my old lifestyle. The last time I went to the doctor was April 2024, and I also quit smoking since then because I couldn't keep up with the medicine costs.

I know that sometimes I go crazy and hurt my relationships, I'm sorry.

Starting from April, I harmed myself more and got mad more for no reason at all. I'll cry when I'm alone at night, then I'll binge eat, then I'll vomit, or I'll cut my hair or cut my arm. During the day I often fast, only eating a little. I also sleep very poorly, I stay up until morning, or I don't want to sleep (because I also have a graduation thesis to complete), if I'm too tired I will fall asleep. I sometimes smoke, but I only smoke to put cigarettes in my hand, so when I quit smoking I bought a razor. 

I live with my older sister, 2 year old niece and younger brother. I am very close to my niece, but since the day she got heavier, my sister (who is pregnant) is very irritable, and sometimes speaks loudly to me, which I can't stand. The other day my nephew went to take a bath, I went in to play with him, and my sister chased him away and said there was no need, so I slowly walked out, because in the past when I had good control, I was the one who picked him up from school, played with him so he wouldn't bother mom, bathed him, and sometimes I even cooked (even though I was really obsessed about whether the meal I cooked was valuable or not). So sometimes my sisters ask me to cook for myself (I know they're worried about me) but then I don't cook. I don't say this to say bad things about the people around me, I just want to tell you about the smallest things that make me panic and worry.

I have a relationship. Many times when I get angry, I want my girlfriend to break up with me, because knowing you is so tiring and annoying, I want everyone to stay away from me. I'm so scared that I'm angry. I'm just angry in an annoying way, like telling you to eat rice, if you don't eat then tell me, he will make an angry face, and speak in a slightly sharp voice, but not mean to you. But my girlfriend doesn't like me to read a lot or read a lot of psychiatric books. My partner says she'll get caught up in it, she'll get caught up in her own world, and she thinks no one will understand her. My husband restrained me when I cut my hand. One time when I bought cigarettes, my husband confiscated them, because he told me that he wouldn't let me smoke the way he smoked (he lit the cigarette in his hand after smoking). After that, he let me read his ex's love letter, he said it was real love, and in that pile of papers there was also a letter I wrote. When I had the photo, it was okay, but when I came home I went crazy and thought that I wasn't a good lover and that I was so tired of loving myself, but why did you still keep the nyc email, why was your riot account name the name of your ex-lover (because the account name can't be changed) but the password was me, but I didn't want that, I felt like I was putting it on the table. Even though I know that my thoughts are silly and childish, and you have a good reason for that. That day I cut my hand very deeply, of course I lost my temper many times and wanted to commit suicide, I even researched many ways to die, but I still had enough sense to stay calm. When I found out you cut your hand, you told me to leave you alone and do whatever you want. If you keep doing that, no one will believe you, and you'll get mad when you're alone. But after that, I didn't dare cut my hand back even though I was very uneasy, I was afraid you wouldn't trust me anymore. 

I'm still very thirsty for bad dopamine. I play games when I'm panicked to forget reality. I've been cooking for so long that I demand perfection, otherwise I'll throw it all away. Even though there are days when I go out and walk for a long time to look at the streets, and days when I wear makeup and wear a skirt to school, my mother says ""If you're happy and pretty like that, who cares"", but it's not like that, I feel heavy because that's just my face showing for everyone to see. 

This article is too long, I hope everyone will stay and read it, and give me some insight, everyone's perspective and everyone's subjective opinions. Thank you.","Rơi vào thói quen xấu, khó khăn trong việc tìm lại bản ngã, lối sống lành mạnh và giữ mối quan hệ thường trực với mọi người Chào mọi người trong sub ạ.

Em năm nay 22 tuổi, em được chẩn đoán và chữa trầm cảm 2 năm nay. Tới hồi tháng 8 năm ngoái thì mọi thứ nặng hơn, khiến em dường như khó quay lại lối sống cũ. Lần cuối em đi khám là tháng 4 năm 2024, và em cũng bỏ thuốc từ đợt đó bởi không theo nổi tiền thuốc.

Em biết là nhiều khi em phát điên liên và làm tổn thương tới các mối quan hệ của em, em xin lỗi.

Bắt đầu từ tháng 4, em self harm nhiều hơn, nổi điên lên nhiều hơn không vì lý do gì cả. Em sẽ khóc lóc khi ở một mình trong đêm, rồi em binge eat, rồi em ói hết ra, hoặc em cắt tóc hoặc cắt tay. Ban ngày em cũng thường nhịn ăn, chỉ ăn một chút thôi. Em ngủ cũng rất dở, em thức tới sáng, hoặc em không muốn ngủ (bởi em cũng đang có đồ án tốt nghiệp cần hoàn thành), nếu mệt quá em sẽ lăn ra ngủ. Thi thoảng em hút thuốc, nhưng em hút chỉ để châm thuốc vào tay, nên lúc bỏ thuốc thì em mua dao lam. 

Em ở với chị gái ruột, cháu 2 tuổi và em trai. Em rất thân với cháu, nhưng từ ngày em nặng hơn, chị em (đang có bầu) rất hay cáu kỉnh, và nhiều khi nói em to tiếng mà em không chịu được. Hôm trước cháu em đi tắm, em vào chơi với nó, thì chị đuổi ra bảo không cần nên em lủi thủi đi ra, bởi ngày xưa khi em còn kiểm soát được tốt, em vốn là người đón nó đi học về, chơi với nó để nó k quấy mẹ, tắm cho nó, đôi khi em còn nấu ăn (dù em thực sự rất ám ảnh về việc bữa cơm mình nấu có giá trị hay không). Nên thi thoảng chị em kêu em tự nấu ăn đi (em biết là lo cho em) nhưng rồi em cũng k nấu. Em nói ra không phải để nói xấu những người xung quanh em, chỉ là em muốn kể ra những thứ nhỏ nhất cũng làm em hoảng và lo lắng.

Em có ghệ. Nhiều khi em lên cơn em đòi ghệ chia tay em đi, bởi quen em thật mệt và phiền phức, em muốn mọi người tránh xa em ra. Em rất sợ ghệ em cáu. Ghệ em cáu kiểu khó chịu thôi, kiểu ví dụ bảo em ăn cơm đi, em có ăn không thì bảo, ảnh sẽ làm mặt cáu, và nói giọng hơi đanh thép chút thôi, chứ không xấu tính với em. Nhưng ghệ em không thích em đọc nhiều hoặc xem nhiều sách tâm thần, ghệ em bảo em sẽ cuốn vào nó, em sẽ thu vào trong thế giới của mình, và em nghĩ không ai hiểu em. Ghệ em khắc chế khi em cắt tay, có một lần em mua thuốc, thì ghệ em tịch thu, bởi anh bảo là hút kiểu em thì không cho hút (là hút xong châm thuốc vào tay). Xong rồi ảnh cho em đọc thư tình của ghệ cũ, ảnh bảo đó là tình cảm thật, và trong đống giấy tờ đấy cũng có thư em viết. Lúc có ảnh thì không sao, nhưng lúc em về em phát điên lên và nghĩ rằng mình chẳng phải một người yêu tốt này kia, rồi yêu mình mệt quá, mà sao anh còn giữ thư nyc, sao tên tài khoản riot của anh là tên người yêu cũ (tại vì tên tài khoản không thể đổi được) nhưng mật khẩu là em, nhưng em không muốn như thế, em như đặt lên bàn cân. Dù em biết là những suy nghĩ của em vớ vẩn và trẻ con, và anh cũng có lý do chính đáng cho việc đấy. Hôm đó em cắt tay sâu lắm, đương nhiên em nhiều lần mất bình tĩnh và muốn tự sát, em thậm chí còn tìm hiểu nhiều cách chết, nhưng em vẫn đủ lý trí để giữ bình tĩnh. Lúc anh biết em cắt tay, anh bảo là kệ em em muốn làm gì thì làm, em cứ làm vậy hoài thì ai tin em nữa, em lại nổi khùng lúc ở một mình. Nhưng sau đấy em chưa dám cắt tay lại dù rất bứt rứt, em sợ anh không tin mình nữa. 

Em còn rất khát dopamine xấu. Em chơi game lúc hoảng để quên đi thực tại, em nấu ăn thật lâu rồi em đòi hỏi sự hoàn hảo, nếu không em sẽ vứt hết đi. Dù cho có những ngày em ra ngoài, đi bộ thật lâu nhìn ngắm phố phường, và những ngày em makeup mặc váy đi học, mẹ em bảo ""đấy cứ vui vẻ xinh xắn như vậy thì ai phải lo"", nhưng nó không phải vậy, em cảm thấy nặng trĩu bởi vì đấy chỉ là khuôn mặt em thể hiện ra cho mọi người xem. 

Bài viết dài quá, mong mọi người nán lại đọc, và cho em một số insight, góc nhìn của mọi người và ý kiến chủ quan của mọi người ạ. Em cám ơn.

1m6d3kv,1753188266.0,2025-07-22 12:44:26,"I have paranoid + ocd hello everyone, as the title above, I myself am currently quite struggling and uncomfortable when suffering from the above two diseases (at least I surmise that is the case). To make it simple and easy to imagine, I would like to list all my symptoms:


• paranoids:

- care too much about what other people think about you, afraid they are thinking bad things about you and will harm you.
- Suspicion that my phone is being tracked, the Facebook account I'm using has been hacked and that person is using my data to do bad things.
- Suspicion that there is a hidden camera in the house, in the room, you are being watched and controlled.
- Fear of being scandalized, being defamed, becoming the center of criticism on social networks (even though I haven't done anything bad, I'm afraid that in real life, if someone is dissatisfied with my actions, they will secretly take a photo of me and post it on the Internet).
- Always suspect that others know your secret, know your password.
- The feeling that there is a group or organization that speaks ill of you behind your back or intends to harm you.
- afraid of the gaze outside the window looking in. My living room has windows and a balcony, so I'm always afraid of outsiders looking into my house -&gt; Don't dare to go naked or naked when going out to the living room (when you're home alone).
- I feel worried and suspicious that a strange phone number suddenly called me. I'm afraid that if I just pick up the phone, all my data will be hacked or the person on the other end will threaten me with something.
- At night, when you hear a slight noise, you think there's a thief or stranger in your house.
- afraid of the feeling that people are naturally too close to me -&gt; fear of being taken advantage of.
- In my head I almost only think about the worst scenarios, which is that I will be slandered, hated, ostracized, that I will fail, but I rarely imagine the prospect of having glory and advantages. 
- Always afraid of being compared to others or losing something to others. Every time I think like that, I feel worried and embarrassed, thinking about the feeling of being laughed at by everyone around me if I lose.
- If you see someone glancing at you on the street or accidentally glancing at someone, you're afraid they'll call you back and punch you.
- difficult to completely relax 100%. Of course, I also have my own hobbies and passions such as listening to music and playing sports, but then after a while, those small scenarios and fears suddenly came.
- always in a state of over-vigilance, thinking of ways to deal with those bad scenarios (but they don't happen and aren't real, but I'm still stuck, hicc).


• ocd:

- Wash your hands, feet, and mouth so many times a day that your mother complains that you waste too much water.
- afraid of bacteria, small stains. Especially when you get goosebumps, wash thoroughly when you accidentally touch insects such as cockroaches, lizards, spiders, or cobwebs.
- Seeing that bowls, chopsticks, cups are not very clean or have small stains, I don't dare to eat or drink (because of this, I am often teased by my grandparents and parents that I am afraid of getting dirty).
- Every time you go out, you often have to check to see if you have turned off the power, turned off the faucet, and locked the door. After I finished, I left, but after walking for a while I got worried, so I came back to check more times to make sure it was new.
- Obsessed with time, like I like to watch time pass. The type of person who likes to waste time, likes to count numbers and days. watch the time, check the time, calculate the time in all kinds of ways.
- Look back and forth at night to see if the door is really locked. After a while, I felt guilty and felt like I hadn't locked it yet so I looked back.
- Everything for me must always be equal. Like if you take 3 steps in one box, then you can only take 3 steps in the next box, take 3 steps less or more then return to the previous box to move again.
- self-doubt, worrying about whether every little thing you do is effective. It's like worrying about not knowing if you charge the car or if the car will charge the battery. I set an alarm, I don't know if it will go off tomorrow morning. I submitted my assignment, I don't know if it actually reached her. I wrote sbd, I don't know if I really wrote sbd or if I forgot?
- scared, worried that I've forgotten something. It's like packing up when you come back from a trip. I keep doubting and worrying that I've forgotten something at the travel destination.
- Sensitive, avoids bad situations. 
- If you see someone else coughing or sneezing near you, you are afraid that they will transmit the disease to you.
- Drinking water or eating something is always afraid of eating or drinking by mistake. It's like when I eat rice, I suddenly see something dirty and spit it out. It turns out it's just black grit in the rice, but I still don't dare swallow it. It's the same when drinking water. If you notice there are ants in the water, spit them out, especially","Bản Thân Bị Mắc Paranoid + OCD Hello mọi người, như tiêu đề ở trên, bản thân em hiện tại đang khá chật vật và khó chịu khi bị mắc 2 căn bệnh trên (ít nhất là do em phỏng đoán là như thế). Để cho đơn giản và dễ hình dung, em xin phép được liệt kê toàn bộ biểu hiện của em ạ:


• Paranoid:

- Quan tâm quá nhiều vào suy nghĩ của người khác về mình, sợ họ đang nghĩ xấu về mình và sẽ làm hại mình.
- Nghi ngờ máy điện thoại đang bị theo dõi, nick facebook mình đang dùng bị hack và kẻ đấy đang sử dụng những dữ liệu của mình để làm điều xấu.
- Nghi trong nhà, trong phòng có camera quay lén, bản thân đang bị theo dõi và đang bị kiểm soát.
- Lo sợ bị phốt, bị nói xấu, trở thành tâm điểm chỉ trích trên mạng xã hội (Mặc dù bản thân không làm gì xấu nhưng lo sợ ngoài đời có ai đó không vừa ý với hành động của mình thì họ sẽ chụp lén mình xong đăng lên mạng phốt).
- Bao giờ cũng nghi ngờ người khác biết bí mật của mình, biết mật khẩu của mình.
- Cảm giác có một group, tổ chức nào đó nói xấu sau lưng mình hoặc có ý hãm hại mình.
- Lo sợ ánh nhìn ngoài cửa sổ nhìn vào. Phòng khách nhà em có cửa sổ và ban công nên em luôn lo sợ người ngoài nhìn vào nhà mình -&gt; không dám cởi trần, cởi truồng khi ra phòng khách (khi bản thân đang ở nhà một mình).
- Thấy lo lắng, nghi ngờ số điện thoại lạ tự nhiên gọi đến cho mình. Sợ chỉ cần nhấc máy một phát là mọi thông tin dữ liệu của mình sẽ bị hack hoặc người ở đầu dây bên kia sẽ đe doạ mình gì đó.
- Buổi tối khẽ nghe thấy tiếng động nhẹ gì đó là nghĩ trong nhà mình đang có trộm, người lạ nào đấy.
- Sợ cái cảm giác mọi người tự nhiên thân thiết với mình thái quá -&gt; sợ bị lợi dụng.
- Trong đầu hầu như chỉ nghĩ đến những viễn cảnh tệ nhất, nào là bản thân bị nói xấu, bị ghét, tẩy chay, bản thân sẽ thất bại chứ ít khi tưởng tượng ra viễn cảnh mình có được hào quang, thuận lợi. 
- Luôn sợ bị so sánh với người khác hoặc thua người khác cái gì đó. Mỗi lần nghĩ như vậy là sẽ tự cảm thấy lo lắng, xấu hổ nghĩ đến cái cảm giác sẽ bị mọi người xung quanh cười ngạo nếu bản thân thua cuộc.
- Đi đường thấy ai liếc qua mình hoặc lỡ liếc qua người ta cũng sợ bị họ gọi lại đấm.
- Khó để có thể hoàn toàn thư giãn 100%. Đương nhiên là em cũng có những thú vui, đam mê riêng như nghe nhạc, chơi thể thao nhưng rồi một hồi mấy cái viễn cảnh, nỗi sợ vặt đấy lại tự nhiên kéo đến.
- Bao giờ cũng luôn trong trạng thái đề phòng quá mức, nghĩ đến những phương án để đối phó với những viễn cảnh tồi tệ đấy (nhưng chúng không diễn ra và không có thật, tuy nhiên bản thân vẫn luôn mắc kẹt, hicc).


• OCD:

- Rửa tay, rửa chân, súc miệng quá mức nhiều lần trong ngày đến nỗi mẹ em còn phàn nàn em rửa nhiều thế tốn nước quá.
- Sợ vi khuẩn, vết bẩn nhỏ. Đặc biệt sởn da gà, rửa thật sạch khi bản thân lỡ đụng vào mấy con côn trùng như gián, thằn lằn, nhện, mạng nhện.
- Thấy bát, đũa, cốc không được sạch lắm hoặc có vết bẩn nhỏ thôi cũng không dám ăn, dám uống (vì cái này nên em hay bị ông bà, bố mẹ trêu là sợ bẩn).
- Mỗi khi đi ra ngoài thường phải kiểm tra xem bản thân đã tắt điện, ngắt vòi nước, khoá cửa hẳn hoi chưa. Xong rồi mới đi, tuy vậy đi một đoạn lại lo lắng, thế là lại quay về kiểm tra thêm nhiều lần nữa cho chắc cú mới thôi.
- Ám ảnh với thời gian, kiểu như em thích nhìn thời gian trôi đi. Kiểu em hay câu giờ, thích đếm số, đếm ngày. Canh giờ, soi giờ, tính giờ đủ kiểu.
- Buổi tối ngó đi ngó lại xem đã khoá cửa thật chưa. Một hồi xong lại áy náy hình như chưa khoá xong lại ra ngó lại.
- Bao giờ cái gì đối với em cũng phải đều. Kiểu như em đi 3 bước trong một ô, thì ô tiếp theo em cũng chỉ được đi 3 bước, đi ít hơn hay nhiều hơn 3 bước là quay lại ô vừa nãy để đi lại.
- Tự đa nghi, lo lắng không biết mọi thứ nhỏ nhặt mình làm có hiệu quả không. Kiểu như lo không biết mình sạc xe, xe có vào pin không. Mình hẹn báo thức, không biết sáng mai nó có kêu không. Mình nộp bài, không biết bài đã thực sự tới tay cô chưa. Mình ghi sbd, không biết có thực sự là mình đã ghi sbd không hay là quên?
- Sợ hãi, lo lắng rằng mình vừa bỏ quên cái gì đó. Kiểu như dọn đồ khi đi du lịch về, em cứ nghi ngờ, lo lắng rằng mình đã bỏ quên một cái gì đó ở chỗ du lịch.
- Nhạy cảm, tránh né trước những tình huống xấu. 
- Thấy người khác ho hay hắt xì gần mình là sợ họ lây truyền bệnh cho mình.
- Uống nước hay ăn cái gì đó là cứ sợ mình ăn nhầm uống nhầm. Kiểu như ăn cơm tự nhiên thấy có gì đó bẩn bẩn là tự nhiên nhả ra, hoá ra chỉ là hạt sạn đen trong cơm nhưng em vẫn không dám nuốt. Uống nước cũng vậy, để ý có con kiến trong nước em cũng nhổ ra, nhất quyết không uống.
- Người khác ăn thừa là mình không dám ăn lại của người ấy.

From around the 3rd year, I started to feel bored with everything, leading to me finding studying very boring and tiring. GPA still falls in the range of 3.5 3.4 but the score doesn't make me happier. Also because of my mood going down, my friends around me weren't happy anymore and weren't close anymore, or in other words I felt like they started to dislike me maybe because I was always indifferent to everyone and negative, but my mood didn't allow me to be happy with everyone, even though I tried to save the friendship after that by telling them how I felt at that time, they thought there was a reason for everything but didn't tell me what the reason was, so now there's no one to go here and there to cheer them up. spirit. I no longer feel interested in my hobby, I also watch the League of Legends tournament and the team I like also loses a lot, when the team wins it's a little fun, the rest is the feeling that this hobby affects my emotions a lot. When I wake up in the morning, I always feel like I have no strength in my body. My hand holding chopsticks trembles like I've lost strength. When I stand up and sit down, my heart beats a little faster. I think everything is because my mental health is not good, now I have no motivation, no friends around, what should I do if I don't want to do anything? I still have a thesis to do, but like this I can't do anything.

GPA vẫn rơi vào tầm 3.5 3.4 nhưng điểm số cũng không làm em vui vẻ hơn được. Cũng vì việc tâm trạng đi xuống, bạn bè xung quanh cũng vì em không vui vẻ mà không còn thân thiết nữa, hay nói cách khác em cảm giác họ bắt đầu không ưa em có lẽ vì em luôn thờ ơ với mọi người và tiêu cực, nhưng tâm trạng không cho phép em vui vẻ với mọi người, dù em đã cố cứu chữa tình bạn sau đó bằng cách nói cảm giác lúc đó cho họ nghe, họ cho rằng cái gì cũng có lý do nhưng không nói cho em lý do là gì, nên giờ không có ai để cùng đi đây đó vực dậy tinh thần. Sở thích em cũng không còn cảm thấy thích thú, em cũng có coi giải lmht mà đội em thích cũng thua nhiều, mấy khi đội thắng thì vui 1 xíu, còn lại là cảm giác sở thích này ảnh hưởng cảm xúc rất nhiều.

17tfve0,1699777333.0,2023-11-12 08:22:13,"Pressure in life, what should I do if I have no one to share it with? I'm a 4th year student, preparing to graduate, having spent 1 year studying abroad in Japan, so I'm 1 year behind my peers. Therefore, I tried very hard to complete the program quickly, studying ahead of schedule just to graduate early to keep up with everyone.

 However, when I completed the program and started working, I was somewhat disappointed. I'm not hiding anything, I studied law, a field that sounds prestigious but in fact when I graduate it's difficult to apply for a job. If I just stop at the bachelor of law level, it will be difficult to get any job. If I want to work as a notary, lawyer, or court, I have to spend another 1 - 1.5 years to get a practicing certificate while the salary is not that good (from the beginning, this was not my desire to study this field). When applying for a job, every place asks for 1-3 or even 4 years of experience for new graduates, so it's quite difficult. Actually, I have a knack for drawing, creative ideas, learned some designs, and also have good Japanese skills so I can switch to studying abroad consulting/teachers in study abroad centers and foreign language centers. 

However, my family always wanted me to pursue a career in notary public. It would be nothing if it were a temporary main income to have money to buy courses and pay for app design, but my family forced me to work in the countryside. I don't like life here, I don't like the people or the environment here. When I first returned from Da Nang to my hometown, I was shocked and absorbed the phrase ""Da Nang people are friendly, kind, honest"". Although it's not good, I have to say that I quite dislike the environment in the countryside, whether in the city or the countryside. Arguments at home, conflicts about direction make the home environment very stressful, my family wants me to get a job quickly, if needed, I apply to the industry so they can relax and not have to worry. I want to find a job on my own. If I need to go far, I will go far. For me, spending time and money to study on my own and find a job is better than applying to the forest ranger industry (250 million application fee). It takes an average of 3-4 years to pay the money and then commit to working there until I get old.

 My family doesn't support me, my friends don't help me either. I have helped many people when they asked about the field of law and legal advice. However, when I needed them, they didn't help me. My best friend, who studied commerce to do graphics, had enough information for me to ask. I still asked to visualize and visualize the areas and things I do well, to give direction, but no, people answered very superficially, giving and avoiding. Looking back, I realized that I was devoted to my friends and turned away. But they treated me like that, of course I don't regret that relationship and put it on the list of toxic relationships that need to be eliminated. Since returning to my hometown, I've been under pressure from work but have no one to share it with, or they don't understand, or they only give advice but can't solve the problem, or don't even care, whatever it is, the feeling they give me is very bad. Maybe only men can understand each other, saying those things to girls they can't understand, or only their lover can understand. At work, I was often asked for goat blood pudding and drinks, only then did they help me. Because I work with middle-aged people 35-40 years old, I'm not very friendly. I don't feel like I'm part of the team. I feel like every morning when I wake up to go to work, my body is tired and lifeless. 

Stressful at home, stressful at work, no one to express or share with now that the scope to meet new people is gone. The same goes for friends in Hanoi, those 1-3 years younger than them, surrounded by old people, children, and friends who live far away, becoming increasingly cold. The reason I keep Facebook is probably just to see posts on some healthy groups, Europe is also happier than the outside world. The ambition is there, the idea is there, it's just lacking supporters, maybe I should try to keep it all quiet inside myself when talking it out with acquaintances won't solve anything, it will only make me more disappointed. By the way, my hometown is Thanh Hoa, anyone here can invite me to coffee, of course I'm not complaining about anything negative, just talking and contemplating life.

Wish everyone a good day.","Áp lực cuộc sống, không có ai để chia sẻ thì phải làm sao? Mình là sinh viên năm 4, chuẩn bị ra trường, đã từng có 1 năm du học Nhật về nên kể ra mình bị chậm 1 năm so với lứa bằng tuổi. Vì vậy nên mình đã rất cố gắng hoàn thành chương trình thật nhanh, học vượt tiến độ chỉ để ra trường thật sớm để theo kịp mọi người.

 Tuy nhiên, khi đã hoàn thành chương trình và bắt đầu bước đầu đi làm, mình có đôi phần thất vọng. Không dấu gì, mình học ngành Luật, một ngành nghe thì có vẻ oai nhưng thật ra khi ra trường xin việc thì lại khó, nếu chỉ dừng lại ở mức độ cử nhân Luật thì sẽ khó để xin được việc gì, muốn làm công chứng, luật sư, tòa án thì phải bỏ thêm 1 - 1,5 năm nữa mới được cấp chứng chỉ hành nghề trong khi lương cũng không khá khẩm là bao (từ đầu đây đã không phải nguyện vọng học ngành này). Nộp hồ sơ xin việc thì nơi nào cũng đề kinh nghiệm 1-3 thậm chí 4 năm cho sinh viên mới ra trường nên cũng khá là khó khăn. Thực ra mình có sở trường vẽ, ý tưởng sáng tạo, học được mấy cái design, ngoài ra còn sẵn vốn tiếng Nhật nên mình có thể chuyển hướng qua Tư vấn du học/ giáo viên trong trung tâm du học, trung tâm ngoại ngữ. 

Tuy vậy, Gia đình mình lại luôn muốn mình theo ngành công chứng, sẽ không là gì nếu nó là 1 ngành thu nhập chính tạm thời để có tiền mua khóa học, trả tiền cho app design nhưng nhà mình lại bắt mình làm ở quê. Mình không thích cuộc sống ở đây, không thích con người cũng như môi trường ở đây, cảm giác hồi đầu khi từ Đà Nẵng về quê mình đã bị sốc và thấm cái câu ""Người Đà Nẵng thân thiện, tốt bụng, thật thà"", dù không hay nhưng phải nói mình khá là không thích môi trường ở quê, dù là ở thành phố hay nông thôn. Tranh cãi ở nhà, mâu thuẫn về định hướng khiến môi trường ở nhà rất áp lực, gia đình mình muốn mình có việc thật nhanh, cần thì xin vào ngành để họ được thảnh thơi không phải lo gì. Mình thì muốn tự mình kiếm việc, cần đi xa mình sẽ đi xa, đối với mình việc bỏ thời gian tiền bạc ra tự học rồi kiếm việc vẫn hơn xin vào ngành Kiểm Lâm (250tr tiền xin) trung bình 3-4 năm mới trả xong tiền để rồi cam kết làm ở đấy tới già.

 Gia đình không ủng hộ, bạn bè cũng không giúp đỡ, mình đã giúp nhiều người khi họ hỏi về lĩnh vực Luật pháp, tư vấn pháp lý, tuy nhiên đến khi mình cần thì họ lại không giúp, bạn thân đấy, học Thương mại ra làm đồ họa, người đấy có đủ thông tin để mình hỏi, vẫn là hỏi để hình dung, mường tượng ra những mảng, những gì mình làm tốt, để định hướng nhưng không, người ta trả lời rất hời hợt, cho có và né tránh, Nghĩ lại thấy mình hết lòng vì bạn bè, quay lại họ lại đối xử vậy, tất nhiền mối quan hệ ấy mình không luyến tiếc gì mà cho vào danh sách mối quan hệ toxic cần phải loại trừ. Từ hồi về quê mình áp lực công việc nhưng không có ai để chia sẻ, hoặc là họ  không hiểu, hoặc là họ chỉ chăm chăm đưa ra lời khuyên nhưng không giải quyết được vấn đề, hoặc thậm chí không quan tâm, dù là gì thì cảm xúc họ đem lại cho mình đều rất tệ. có lẽ chỉ đàn ông mới hiểu cho nhau, nói những điều đấy với con gái họ chẳng thể hiểu được, hoặc phải người yêu thì họ mới hiểu. Ở chỗ làm mình thường xuyên bị gạ bao tiết canh dê, mồi nhậu thì họ mới giúp đỡ, vì làm với người trung tuổi 35- 40 tuổi nên không được thân thiện cho lắm, mình không có cảm giác là 1 phần của tập thể, cảm giác mỗi sáng thức dậy đi làm là cơ thể đã rã rời mất sức sống. 

Ở nhà căng thẳng, đi làm căng thăng, không có ai để bày tỏ, chia sẻ khi giờ đây phạm vi làm quen người mới đã không còn. Bạn bè ở Hà Nội, các lứa hơn kém 1-3 tuổi cũng vậy, xung quanh toàn người già, trẻ em, bạn bè ở xa thì ngày càng lạnh nhạt. Lí do mình có giữ facebook hẳn chỉ còn là để xem các bài viết trên vài hội nhóm healthy, âu cũng hạnh phúc hơn thế giới bên ngoài. Tham vọng có, ý tưởng có, chỉ thiếu người ủng hộ, có lẽ mình nên im lặng cố gắng và giữ lại tất cả bên trong mình khi mà nói ra với người quen cũng không giải quyết được gì, chỉ làm mình thất vọng thêm. Nhân tiện thì quê mình ở Thanh Hóa, bạn nào ở đây có thể rủ mình đi cafe, tất nhiên mình cũng không than thở gây tiêu cực gì đâu, chỉ là nói chuyện chiêm nghiệm cuộc sống thôi.

chúc mọi người một ngày tốt lành.","pressure life , what should i do if i have no one share ? i'm a 4th year student , prepare graduate , have spend 1 year study abroad japan , i'm 1 year behind my peer . therefore , i try very hard complete program quickly , study ahead schedule just graduate early keep up everyone . however , when i complete program start work , i somewhat disappointed . i'm not hide anything , i study law , a field sound prestigious fact when i graduate it's difficult apply a job . if i just stop bachelor law level , will difficult get any job . if i want work a a notary , lawyer , court , i have spend another 1 - 1 . 5 year get a practicing certificate while salary not good ( from beginning , not my desire study field ). when apply a job , every place ask 1 - 3 even 4 year experience new graduate , it's quite difficult . actually , i have a knack draw , creative idea , learn some design , also have good japanese skill i can switch study abroad consult / teacher study abroad center foreign language center . however , my family always want me pursue a career notary public . would nothing if a temporary main income have money buy course pay app design , my family force me work countryside . i don't like life here , i don't like people environment here . when i first return from da nang my hometown , i shock absorb phrase "" da nang people friendly , kind , honest "". although it's not good , i have say i quite dislike environment countryside , whether city countryside . argument home , conflict about direction make home environment very stressful , my family want me get a job quickly , if need , i apply industry they can relax not have worry . i want find a job my own . if i need go far , i will go far . me , spend time money study my own find a job good than apply forest ranger industry ( 250 million application fee ). take an average 3 - 4 year pay money then commit work there until i get old . my family doesn't support me , my friend don't help me either . i have help many people when they ask about field law legal advice . however , when i need them , they didn't help me . my best friend , who study commerce do graphic , have enough information me ask . i still ask visualize visualize area thing i do well , give direction , no , people answer very superficially , give avoid . look back , i realize i devote my friend turn away . they treat me like , course i don't regret relationship put list toxic relationship need eliminate . since return my hometown , i've under pressure from work have no one share , they don't understand , they only give advice can't solve problem , don't even care , whatever , feeling they give me very bad . maybe only men can understand each other , say those thing girl they can't understand , only their lover can understand . work , i often ask goat blood pudding drink , only then do they help me . because i work middle - age people 35 - 40 year old , i'm not very friendly . i don't feel like i'm part team . i feel like every morning when i wake up go work , my body tire lifeless . stressful home , stressful work , no one express share now scope meet new people go . same go friend hanoi , those 1 - 3 year young than them , surround old people , child , friend who live far away , become increasingly cold . reason i keep facebook probably just see post some healthy group , europe also happy than outside world . ambition there , idea there , it's just lack supporter , maybe i should try keep all quiet inside myself when talk out acquaintance won't solve anything , will only make me more disappointed . way , my hometown thanh hoa , anyone here can invite me coffee , course i'm not complain about anything negative , just talk contemplate life . wish everyone a good day .",Depression

I thought it would be like that until the final year, and it was true, but in the final year there was a proposal to participate in robocon 2024. At first, I thought like most people, that this contest is meaningless because it has no application at all. I sent you the link to register twice, but there were still quite a few participants, and you chose to do an internship and then do a thesis.

It wasn't until I got home from internship and went to my friends' robot workshop that I realized I had skipped a course with 102. Looking at the robot, it had very sophisticated mechanisms that no other thesis had. Coming here, although I will work late at night, I will have the opportunity to interact with fellow electrical faculty, gradually learn about the structure and code, and later (who knows) can move into programming. In the past 2 months, you have learned so much, but to return to your own world, the past 2 months I have been interning as a worker, which is exactly the same as the 3rd year internship, my thesis only involves classifying products through image processing and simple grippers. I started to feel jealous because I could never know as much as they did.

And until now I still feel sorry that my knowledge was not expanded while I was in school. If I had knowledge and relationships from robocon, I would definitely get a better job with a higher salary. I know it doesn't matter to top schools because they always have other more interesting programs, but at my school, robocon is almost like a father.","Tham gia robocon có giúp cải thiện trình độ không? Chào các bác, em là sinh viên cơ điện tử mới ra trường 1 năm, trường em là SPKTHY. Hiện tại công việc cũng gọi là ổn định nhưng lương không quá cao (8-10tr).

Tóm tắt quá trình học đại học của em thì không có gì nổi bật, chỉ có đi học không để rớt môn, đảm bảo đồ án chạy được, có kèo thì bê cỗ chứ không có công việc gia sư, được đi bảo vệ đồ án cuối thì ra trường. Em đã nghĩ là sẽ như vậy cho đến năm cuối, và nó đúng là như vậy thật, nhưng ở năm cuối lại có 1 cái đề xuất tham gia Robocon 2024. Ban đầu thì em cũng nghĩ như đa số mọi người, là cuộc thi này nó vô nghĩa vì nó không ứng dụng gì cả. Thầy có gửi link cho các em đăng ký đến 2 lần nhưng vẫn khá ít người tham gia, và em lại chọn thực tập rồi làm đồ án.

Đến khi thực tập về, vào xưởng làm robot của các bạn chơi thì mới ngỡ ra là mình đã bỏ qua 1 khóa học có 102, nhìn con robot có những cơ cấu rất tinh vi mà không cái đồ án nào có cả. Vào đây tuy làm đến đêm nhưng sẽ có cơ hội giao lưu với các bạn khoa điện nữa, dần dần tìm hiểu về cơ cấu và code, sau này (biết đâu) có thể lái sang mảng lập trình. Trong 2 tháng qua các bạn đã học được quá nhiều, còn quay lại với thế giới của mình, 2 tháng qua em thực tập làm công nhân, lại y hệt đợt thực tập năm 3, làm đồ án thì cũng chỉ có phân loại sản phẩm qua xử lý ảnh và tay gắp đơn giản thôi. Em bắt đầu thấy ghen tị vì mình không bao giờ biết bằng các bạn ấy được.

Và đến giờ em vẫn cảm thấy tiếc vì vốn kiến thức của mình không được mở rộng khi còn ở trong nhà trường, nếu có được tri thức và những mối quan hệ từ robocon, chắc chắn em sẽ kiếm được việc tốt hơn với mức lương cao hơn. Em biết là nó không là gì với các trường top vì các bạn ở đấy luôn có chương trình khác thú vị hơn, nhưng ở trường em thì robocon gần như là bố.","do participate robocon help improve my skill ? hello everyone , i'm a mechatronics student who just graduate 1 year ago , my school spkthy . currently job also call stable salary not too high ( 8 - 10 million ). sum up my college experience , there's nothing outstanding , just go school not fail exam , make sure thesis work , if there's a bet , i'll take job , not have a tutor job , get a defense thesis end then graduate . i think would like until final year , true , final year there a proposal participate robocon 2024 . first , i think like most people , contest meaningless because have no application all . i send you link register twice , there still quite a few participant , you choose do an internship then do a thesis . wasn't until i get home from internship go my friend ' robot workshop i realize i have skip a course 102 . look robot , have very sophisticated mechanism no other thesis have . come here , although i will work late night , i will have opportunity interact fellow electrical faculty , gradually learn about structure code , later ( who know ) can move into program . past 2 month , you have learn much , return your own world , past 2 month i have intern a a worker , which exactly same a 3rd year internship , my thesis only involve classifying product through image processing simple grippers . i start feel jealous because i could never know much a they do . until now i still feel sorry my knowledge not expand while i school . if i have knowledge relationship from robocon , i would definitely get a good job a high salary . i know doesn't matter top school because they always have other more interesting program , my school , robocon almost like a father .",Normal
1inlefy,1739344393.0,2025-02-12 07:13:13,"In my final year of college, I owe 35 subjects. My family still supports me to continue studying. What should I do with my younger sister?
My younger sister is in college this semester is the 8th semester and actually the 9th semester is a graduate internship. But I felt there was a problem, so I went to the school and asked for his transcript to show my parents. It turned out that I owed 35 subjects. However, from the first year, I told my parents to keep an eye on him and ask if he failed and had to retake the course immediately. But my parents kept telling me to ask him, and he said it was okay and believed him. 
Now it turns out that it's the final semester and I've only got 1/4 of the credits to graduate. My parents asked me what he wanted, but he said he still wanted to continue studying this course. This school should tell him to try to focus on retaking the course so that he can graduate in 2 or 3 years 😭
I have a feeling he definitely won't be able to go to this school
He told me that if he still liked this department, he would go to another school with a lower level to earn a degree and get university admission easily, without having to retake the exam. But my parents immediately stopped me and said ""don't talk back, he can try, he promised, if he can't he has to try, it's better to retake the course from the beginning with the first year, pass more than a dozen subjects and then say it's a shame to waste retake the course with the new graduates"".
I thought about all the options: go to another school in the same field, or transfer to another department to do a little manual labor like nursing. If you don't want to study some desk thinking subjects, your parents will say ""Are you crazy? You don't want to have a good job, so you don't want to advise me to do some miserable job, I don't care if the salary is high, but it's not worth it if it's miserable."" 
The more I talk, the more my parents say they have a headache and don't talk anymore to avoid it. Second, they turn to me and tell this 32-year-old guy to go out and find a wife because he stays at home all day, where can he find a wife 😳
Let's talk a little bit about me: I work online remotely from home so I have little contact with women. I only try to go online and make money through apps but I'm not compatible with anyone. My monthly income fluctuates around 40-60 million so I mostly take care of the whole family, my sister takes care of school fees, I don't give my sister any pocket money, but my parents spend almost all of their pension on her.
When I go back to my children, the more I try to think of future scenarios, the more my parents say I'm stuck with my adoptive parents 😬. I can accept this sentence because my parents raised him until he was 30 or so, but if he didn't get a job and become a husband, I would be the one to raise him for the rest of his life 😢. I am very grateful, so I love my family very much, so I will take care of them. But if you work for a low salary and don't get married to live with me, it's very bad for me to support him, but if I can't find a job, don't have a degree, and don't have a husband or children to support, I feel very pressured, and if I have a wife and children, the possibility that my wife won't like to support someone like that is very high.
Let's talk a little more about how to raise children. When I was a child, my parents were very strict with me. They rarely praised me no matter what achievements I had. So I raised a good person but was good at hiding it because even if I showed it off, I wouldn't get anything. I often did the work in groups so as not to reveal that I could do it alone and better than the group.
As for my child, probably because she is a girl, she is very pampered whether she is good or not, so she hides her ignorance, determined to hide what she knows how to do or doesn't know to the end. When she goes to school, she would rather not take the exam or fail than join a group to let everyone know that she is stupid and cannot do it.
The situation is as above, everyone advises me on what I should do, but right now I have no idea + I have to pay 15 million for my child's tuition every semester, not to mention the upcoming retake the course and I have the feeling that no matter how many times I take the courses, I won't be able to pass 😭 my parents criticize me too much. If he learns through it all the time, even if he goes to the doctorate level, I will still help him, but if I spend money on studying and retake the course, I feel like it's a waste of money.
Everyone, please read and comment and give me advice on what to do for the future 😭","Năm cuối đại học nợ 35 môn, gia đình vẫn ủng hộ học tiếp Mọi người ơi em phải làm sao với con em gái em đây
Con em gái em nó học đại học kỳ này là kỳ thứ 8 rồi đúng ra kỳ 9 là thực tập ra trường. Nhưng em thấy có vấn đề quá nên len đến trường nó xin bảng điểm của nó về cho bố mẹ xem thì lộ ra nợ 35 môn, thế mà xuất từ năm nhất em đã dặn bố mẹ phải để ý hỏi han nó trượt phải học lại ngay, mà bố mẹ em cứ bảo hỏi nó rồi, nó bảo không sao và tin nó. 
Giờ vỡ lẽ ra là kỳ cuối rồi mà mới đạt 1/4 tín chỉ để ra trường thì bố mẹ em hỏi cũng chỉ bảo nó muốn gì thì nó bảo vẫn muốn học tiếp khoa này, trường này Nên bảo nó là cố gắng tập trung học lại để 2 3 năm nữa ra trường cũng đc 😭
Em thì có cảm giác chắc chắn nó ko học đc trường này nê
N bảo nó vẫn thích khoa này thì sang trường khác kém hơn để kiếm cái bằng cũng đc h xét tuyển đại học cũng dễ, ko phải thi lại. Nhưng bố mẹ em chặn ngay em lại bảo "" không bàn lui, em nó cố đc, nó hứa rồi, không được cũng phải cố còn hơn học lại từ đầu với năm nhất, qua đc hơn chục môn rồi trả lẽ bỏ phí học lại cùng bọn mới ra trường nó nhục""  chính xác bố mẹ em nói như thế, mà bây giờ nó học lại mấy môn từ kỳ 1 cũng học là 2003 học cũng 2007 thôi.
Em nghĩ đủ hướng nào là học trường khác vẫn ngành đó, nào là chuyển sang khoa khác lao động chân tay 1 tí như điều dưỡng nêu ko muốn học mấy môn suy nghĩ bàn giấy thì bố mẹ em lại nói "" điên à, mầy công việc sướng không muốn lại đi khuyên em làm mấy công việc khổ sở, lương cao thì kệ lương cao chứ, nhưng nó khổ là không được"" 
Em càng nói thì bố mẹ em càng 1 là bảo nhức đầu quá không nói nữa để né tránh, 2 là quay sang em bảo thằng này 32 tuổi ra đường kiếm vợ đi chứ suốt ngày ở nhà lấy đâu ra vợ 😳
Nói qua về em tí là em làm online remote tại gia nên ít tiếp xúc với phái nữ, chỉ cố gắng lên mạng kiếm qua các app mà chưa hợp ai, thu nhập hàng tháng của em giao động 40-60tr nên hầu như em lo cho cả nhà, tiền học em gái em lo, em ko cho em gái em tiền tiêu vặt nhưng bố me em gần như dành hết lương huư cho nó
Quay lại con em em thì em càng cố nghĩ ra các viễn cảnh tương lai thì bố mẹ em lại bảo cũng lắm ở nhà bố mẹ nuôi 😬. Câu này là em chịu rồi vì bố mẹ em máy ra nuôi nó đến đc 30 hoặc hơn tí thôi chứ nó mà ko đi làm làm chồng thì em là người nuôi nó cả đời 😢. Em rất tình nghĩa thế nên gia đình là em rất yêu quý nên em sẽ nuôi thật. Nhưng kiểu đi làm lương thấp không lấy chồng ở với em thì em hỗ trợ nó là rất bt, nhưng ko kiếm đc việc gì, không bằng cấp, không chồng con mà em nuôi thì em cảm thấy rất áp lực, và nếu em có vợ con thì khả năng vợ em sẽ không thích nuôi 1 người như thế là rất cao
Nói qua 1 chút nữa về cách nuôi dạy con thì bố mẹ em rất khắt khe hồi bé với em, ít khi khen em dù em có thành tích gì, thành ra nuôi được 1 người giỏi nhưng giấu giỏi vì có khoe ra cũng ko được gì, các công việc em hay làm nhóm để ko lộ ra mình có thể làm đc 1 mình và tốt hơn cả nhóm
Còn con em em chắc vì là con gái nên rất được chiều dù giỏi hay kém nên thành ra nó là giấu dốt, nhất quyết che giấu việc mình biết làm hay ko biết đến cùng, đi học nó thà không thi, trượt còn hơn vào làm nhóm để mọi người biết nó dốt ko làm được
Tình hình là như trên, mọi người tư vấn cho em nên làm gì chứ hiện tại là em ko có ý kiến được gì + phải đóng tiền học cho con em mỗi kỳ 15 triệu, chưa kể sắp tới học lại mà em có cảm giác các môn nó học lại có học bao nhiêu lần cũng không qua được 😭 bố mẹ em bào rút em quá đáng luôn. Nó mà học phát qua luôn thì có học đến tiến sĩ em cũng giúp, chứ bỏ tiền ra cho học đi học lại thì em cảm thấy phí tiền
Mọi người đọc rồi nêu nhận xét rồi tư vấn hay cho em xin hướng giải quyết phải làm như nào cho tương lai với ạ 😭","my final year college , i owe 35 subject . my family still support me continue study . what should i do my young sister ? my young sister college semester 8th semester actually 9th semester a graduate internship . i felt there a problem , i go school ask his transcript show my parent . turn out i owe 35 subject . however , from first year , i tell my parent keep an eye him ask if he fail have retake course immediately . my parent keep tell me ask him , he say okay believe him . now turn out it's final semester i've only get 1 / 4 credit graduate . my parent ask me what he want , he say he still want continue study course . school should tell him try focus retake course he can graduate 2 3 year i have a feeling he definitely won't able go school he tell me if he still like department , he would go another school a low level earn a degree get university admission easily , without have retake exam . my parent immediately stop me say "" don't talk back , he can try , he promise , if he can't he have try , it's good retake course from beginning first year , pas more than a dozen subject then say it's a shame waste retake course new graduate "". i think about all option : go another school same field , transfer another department do a little manual labor like nursing . if you don't want study some desk think subject , your parent will say "" you crazy ? you don't want have a good job , you don't want advise me do some miserable job , i don't care if salary high , it's not worth if it's miserable ."" more i talk , more my parent say they have a headache don't talk anymore avoid . second , they turn me tell 32 - year - old guy go out find a wife because he stay home all day , where can he find a wife let's talk a little bit about me : i work online remotely from home i have little contact woman . i only try go online make money through apps i'm not compatible anyone . my monthly income fluctuates around 40 - 60 million i mostly take care whole family , my sister take care school fee , i don't give my sister any pocket money , my parent spend almost all their pension her . when i go back my child , more i try think future scenario , more my parent say i'm stuck my adoptive parent . i can accept sentence because my parent raise him until he 30 , if he didn't get a job become a husband , i would one raise him rest his life . i very grateful , i love my family very much , i will take care them . if you work a low salary don't get marry live me , it's very bad me support him , if i can't find a job , don't have a degree , don't have a husband child support , i feel very pressured , if i have a wife child , possibility my wife won't like support someone like very high . let's talk a little more about how raise child . when i a child , my parent very strict me . they rarely praise me no matter what achievements i have . i raise a good person good hide because even if i show off , i wouldn't get anything . i often do work group a not reveal i could do alone good than group . a my child , probably because she a girl , she very pampered whether she good not , she hide her ignorance , determine hide what she know how do doesn't know end . when she go school , she would rather not take exam fail than join a group let everyone know she stupid cannot do . situation a above , everyone advise me what i should do , right now i have no idea + i have pay 15 million my child's tuition every semester , not mention upcoming retake course i have feeling no matter how many time i take course , i won't able pass my parent criticize me too much . if he learn through all time , even if he go doctorate level , i will still help him , if i spend money study retake course , i feel like it's a waste money . everyone , please read comment give me advice what do future",Depression

I'm ready to confide in a little bit and ask for a few words of encouragement.
The story started in the old days when I had just finished taking the c3 exam. At that time, I was confused and didn't know what I wanted, so I closed my eyes and chose randomly just because that industry was hot at that time, in my area I had no interest at all and was not at all suitable for the chosen industry. I was already lazy and weak, and my industry was unique in that it was difficult to learn, so I had to work hard and work hard. That's why now I'm having to pay the price for my lack of thorough thinking and irresponsibility in the past. Going to class every day, I struggle to keep up with my grades, I'm failing in my major and have a lot of debt. In theory, I should have graduated last summer, but this year is almost the end of my 5th year and I still haven't paid off all my debt, and I'm preparing for my 6th year, and I still have 2 or 3 courses to retake the course for the second time and still haven't passed.

I once wanted to drop out of school but my family did not agree and still wanted me to continue studying to get my degree. Looking back at my C3 friends and fellow graduates who have been working and earning money for a year now, looking back, I'm both stupid and have poor communication skills, my ability to integrate is almost zero, I don't have any friends or acquaintances nearby, I only know how to struggle alone to pay and fail the subject, stubbornly trying to salvage a college degree to satisfy my parents, while the future is gray, the past few years of studying as a freeloader have cost my family a lot of money. The family is not well-off, but the parents' health is getting weaker day by day, so the pressure increases. I feel ashamed, humiliated and truly incompetent

Recently, I failed another class, so I'm even more bored, thinking all the time, not knowing where I'm going, not knowing what to do or what I want, the more I think, the more tired I feel, the more negative I feel. I'm so sad, guys, I'm really lonely and depressed that I have to go online and confide like this. I just hope you guys can give me a little advice or a little encouragement or whatever, hic, I just hope someone sympathizes and shares with me.","Cần 1 chút lời khuyên và động lực về chuyện nợ môn và ra trường muộn Chào các bác, ở đây có ai đi học đại học mà đã từng bị nợ môn ra trường muộn chưa? Và các bác đối mặt với việc bị nợ môn ra trường muộn và vượt qua nó như thế nào ạ?

Sẵn tiện tâm sự chút xíu đồng thời xin các bác ít lời động viên luôn.
Chuyện bắt đầu từ ngày xưa hồi e mới thi c3 xong lúc đấy mông lung chả biết mình muốn gì thế là nhắm mắt chọn bừa chỉ vì cái ngành đấy lúc đó nó lại đang hot, trong khu chính mình lại chẳng có tí hứng thú nào và cũng chả có tí phù hợp gì với cái ngành đã chọn đã thế bản thân sẵn cái tính lười lại còn kém mà cái ngành của em đặc thù nó vốn khó mà muốn học được thì bắt buộc phải chăm và chịu khó. Xong chính vì vậy mà bây giờ đây bản thân đang phải trả giá vì cái sự suy nghĩ thiếu thấu đáo và cái sự thiếu trách nghiệm của bản thân năm xưa. Ngày ngày đi học đến lớp thì chật vật không theo nổi điểm thì lẹt đẹt môn chuyên ngành thì nợ tùm lum, trên lý thuyết thì lẽ ra mình phải ra trường từ hè năm ngoái rồi nhưng năm nay sắp hết năm thứ 5 rồi mà vẫn chưa trả nợ được hết, lại chuẩn bị sang năm thứ 6 đã vậy còn có 2 3 môn học lại lần 2 mà vẫn chưa qua.

Đã từng có ý muốn bỏ học nhưng gia đình thì không đồng ý và vẫn muốn e cố theo nốt để lấy cái bằng. Nhìn bạn bè c3 đồng lứa ra trường đi làm kiếm tiền được 1 năm rồi trong khi nhìn lại mình vừa đần độn vừa đụt kỹ năng giao tiếp, khả năng hòa nhập thì gần như bằng 0 chả có bạn bè người quen gì ở kế bên chỉ biết lủi thủi 1 thân 1 mình đi trả nợ môn, cố chấp để vớt vát được cái bằng đh về cho bố mẹ vừa lòng, trong khi tương lai thì xám xịt, mấy năm giời đi học ăn bám ngốn mất bao nhiêu tiền của gia đình mà gia đình thì vốn chả khá giả gì mà càng ngày sức khỏe của bố mẹ càng yếu đi thế là lại càng thêm áp lực. Cảm thấy xấu hổ, nhục nhã và kém cỏi thật sự các bác ạ

Vừa mới đây lại tạch thêm môn nữa nên lại càng thêm chán, ngẫm nghĩ suốt chả biết mình đi đâu về đâu, chả biết phải làm gì muốn gì, càng nghĩ chỉ càng thấy oải, càng thấy thêm tiêu cực. Buồn bực quá các bác ạ thật tình cô đơn và chán nản lắm rồi mới phải lên mạng tâm sự như này. Chỉ mong các bác cho em ít lời khuyên hoặc ít lời động viên hoặc cái gì cũng được với ạ hic em chỉ mong có ai đó đồng cảm chia sẻ cùng thôi ạ.

In 11th grade, I started cutting glass, but my degree had skyrocketed to 6 degrees + chaos, then in 12th grade, I started career counseling. At that time, I didn't know what I liked, so I registered my aspirations (business administration, IT...) during high school. Whenever I was stressed, I would turn on s\* movies to relieve myself.  
I was accepted into the IT major in Ho Chi Minh City (at that time I didn't know what IT was, the registration form was vague...). When I entered the school, I felt like I made the right choice? In the first semester, I still passed all the subjects, but the next semester was a series of nightmares of failing the subject (1 subject, 2 subjects, 3 subjects... then 10 subjects). When I was stressed, I watched s\* po\*n movies to relieve stress, but I became dependent on it. Every time I was stressed, I would watch movies and combine them hand-in-hand. At the peak of the 2020 - 2021 epidemic, at that time I was very stressed, could not leave the house for a year, and owed 17 academic subjects for the second time. My eye level increased to 8.75 on one side, 9.25 on the other side. By the 4th year, I had only accumulated 82/158 credits. At that time, I almost gave up and was encouraged by my family. I regretted the time that had passed. I started to try hard, pay off debt (retake the course for those younger than 2 or 3 years old, get acquainted...) after about 1.5 - nearly 2 years of plowing + paying off debt, I finally had 158/158 credits + English output to graduate.  
  
During the time I went to school, the main vehicle was the bus, so I didn't know how to ride a motorbike (even though I knew how to ride a bicycle). Every time I looked at a motorbike (in my head, I imagined, thought too much, my hands were sweaty, my feet were cold...) I was mentally unstable.  
  
I've been posting CVs for the past 4 months and haven't had a job. I've failed 1 or 2 times  
I often think a lot, every time I think I pull my own hair, I don't know if I'm mentally ill or not.  
  
I'm very hopeless right now, with no way out. Please give me some advice or words to help me wake up. Thank you","Thất bại cùng cực Em năm nay 24 tuổi , đúng nghĩa Loser , đáy xã hội . Bây giờ em thật sự trống rỗng, không biết tương lai đi về đâu . Cuộc đời em không có niềm vui , toàn buồn phiền tự ti  
Ba em mất sớm , một mình mẹ em nuôi ăn học . Bản thân em da trắng hiền , nhát gan tâm lí yếu  
  
Đến năm lớp 8 , thằng trong lớp kiếm chuyện và đấm vào ngực ,nhéo ngực, lúc đi về cảm giác đau nhói ở ngực bị sưng ngực sau một thời gian bị nữ hóa tuyến vú ( 1 bên nhô ra như phụ nữ , 1 bên thì bình thường) em rất tự ti và không bao giờ cởi trần vì sợ mọi người dè bỉu , nhìn khác lạ .  
  
Đến năm cấp ba thì em vào 1 lớp khác, Em không đi học thêm nên các giáo viên cũng gây khó dễ , mắt lúc này có dấu hiệu cận ngồi bàn thứ 2 không thấy chữ gì , học 1 năm kh đeo kính ( cảm giác kiểu bị cận kh dám nói ... ) . đến năm lớp 11 thì bắt đầu cắt kính nhưng độ thì đã tăng chóng mặt 6 độ + loạn , Sau đó lớp 12 thì bắt đầu tư vấn hướng nghiệp , lúc đó em cũng không biết mình thích gì, nên đăng kí nguyện vọng (Quản trị kinh doanh, CNTT ...) trong khoảng thời gian học cấp ba , mỗi khi em stress thì em mở phim s\* lên để giải tỏa  
Em trúng tuyển vào ngành CNTT ở HCM (lúc đó em cũng không biết CNTT là làm cái gì , kiểu đăng kí mơ hồ ...) , Lúc vào học em cảm thấy liệu mình chọn có đúng không ? Học kì 1 thì vẫn qua tất cả các môn, nhưng học kì sau là chuỗi ngày ác mộng tạch môn ( 1 môn , 2 môn , 3 môn ... rồi 10 môn ), lúc stress thì em xem phim s\* po\*n để giải tỏa căng thẳng , nhưng bị phụ thuộc vào nó , mỗi lần stress là lại xem phim ròi kết hợp way tay. Đỉnh điểm vào lúc dịch 2020 - 2021 thì lúc đó em stress nặng , không ra khỏi nhà 1 năm , nợ 17 môn cảnh cáo học vụ lần 2. mắt tăng độ 1 bên lên 8.75 , 1 bên 9.25 độ Đến năm 4 thì mới tích lũy 82/158 tín . lúc đấy em gần như gục ngã bỏ cuộc , được gia đình động viên , em đã rất hối hận về những khoảng thời gian đã trôi qua . Em bắt đầu try hard , cày trả nợ( học lại với các bạn nhỏ hơn 2 3 tuổi, làm quen ...) sau khoảng 1,5 - gần 2 năm cày + trả nợ cuối cùng em đã đủ 158/158 tín chỉ + tiếng anh đầu ra để ra trường ,  
  
Trong khoảng thời gian đi học phương tiện chủ yếu là xe bus nên xe máy em không biết chạy ( mặc dù biết chạy xe đạp) , mỗi lần nhìn xe máy ( trong đầu em tưởng tượng , suy nghĩ nhiều lung tung , tay đổ mồ hôi, chân lạnh ...) tinh thần không ổn định .  
  
Em rải CV 4 tháng này không có job , pv trượt 1 , 2 lần  
Em hay suy nghĩ nhiều , mỗi lần suy nghĩ em lại giật tóc chính mình , không biết mình có bị tâm thần hay không.  
  
Em hiện giờ đang rất bế tắc , không lối thoát , nhờ các bác cho lời khuyên hoặc lời chửi gì đó để em tỉnh ngộ hơn ạ .

1co6j5h,1715285066.0,2024-05-09 20:04:26,"I'm very lucky but I turned myself into a loser. Hello everyone, tomorrow is my college graduation ceremony and now I can't be happy because I'm actually a loser now. I think back to myself, how many opportunities have I missed so far just because I'm cowardly and lazy.

about education:
I realized that in all my studies from elementary school to college, I never tried my best, but I was still lucky to get into a specialized school (even though it was only a last-ditch ticket). I was lucky to get into a top school, but during this time in college I was lazy, just hanging out at home playing games all day. I owed a lot of subjects (25 credits), but I still graduated on time because I worked hard during the summer, teachers supported me, and used fireworks.
=&gt; As a result, I now have no professional knowledge at all

about work:
I also did a few part-time jobs during my studies. My family is in Hanoi, so I mainly worked part-time to get money to go out and pay for failing the subject, so I only did random jobs and didn't develop any skills. I was also lucky to get a job through a school affiliated with a business (2 year contract, 1x million/month not included) but I quit after a few weeks because I needed to prepare to study abroad for a master's degree (I will explain this part below).
=&gt;Now I'm unemployed, staying at home

About love and affection:
I'm also very lucky to always be considered handsome. When I go to work and school, I get a lot of girls to talk to me and actively flirt, but I'm also too stupid and cowardly.
=&gt; I haven't had a relationship yet, I've never even held a girl's hand

And now my parents have given me another chance to study abroad for a master's degree (at first I didn't agree but my parents convinced me to go so I wouldn't have to go to Nvqs and open up new opportunities and have now paid the deposit) but maybe I'm about to throw this opportunity away! Because I'm always hesitant, I won't be able to file in time, and I'll be called for nvqs. Surely a guy like me couldn't survive 2 weeks in there.

Maybe my only way out now is 44","Tôi rất may mắn nhưng tôi tự biến mình thành 1 loser Xin chào mọi người, ngày mai là lễ tốt nghiệp đại học của tôi mà giờ tôi không vui nổi vì thực sự bây giờ tôi là 1 thằng loser, tôi tự suy nghĩ lại từ trước đến nay tôi đã bỏ lỡ không biết bao nhiêu cơ hội chỉ vì tôi hèn nhát và lười biếng.

Về học vấn:
Tôi nhận thấy trong cả tất cả quá trình học từ Cấp 1 lên đại học, tôi chưa bao giờ nỗ lực hết sức nhưng tôi vẫn may mắn được vào trường chuyên lớp chọn (Dù là vé vớt mà thôi). Tôi may mắn đỗ được vào 1 trường thuộc top đầu, nhưng khoảng thời gian đại học này là lúc mà tôi lười nhác, cả ngày chỉ rủ rú trong nhà chơi game. Tôi nợ rất nhiều môn (25 tín), nhưng vẫn tốt nghiệp đúng hạn do cày cuốc kì hè, thầy cô nâng đỡ và dùng pháo.
=&gt; Hệ quả là giờ t ko có tí kiến thức chuyên môn nào cả

Về công việc:
Tôi cx có làm một vài công việc Part-time trong thời gian học, nhà tôi ở Hà Nội nên làm thêm chủ yếu lấy tiền đi chơi và trả nợ môn nên toàn làm mấy việc linh tinh không phát triển đc kĩ năng gì. Tôi cũng may mắn có được 1 job thông qua trường liên kết vs doanh nghiệp (kí 2 năm, 1x triệu/tháng chưa OT) nhưng tôi đã nghỉ sau mấy tuần vì tôi cần chuẩn đi du học thạc sĩ (Đoạn này tôi sẽ giải thích ở dưới)
=&gt;Bây giờ tôi thất nghiệp, ru rú ở nhà

Về tình yêu, tình cảm:
Tôi cũng rất may mắn khi luôn được nhận xét là đẹp trai. Khi tôi đi làm và đi học, tôi cx đc kha khá các bạn nữ bắt chuyện và chủ động tán tỉnh nhưng tôi cũng quá ngu và hèn nhát.
=&gt; Chưa có nổi 1 mối tình thậm chí chưa 1 lần nắm tay gái

Và giờ tôi được bố mẹ cho thêm 1 cơ hội nữa là cho đi du học thạc sĩ (lúc đầu t ko đồng ý nhưng bố mẹ thuyết phục tôi đi để ko phải đi nvqs và mở ra cơ hội mới và giờ đã đóng tiền deposit rồi) nhưng có lẽ tôi sắp vứt đi cơ hội này rồi! Vì tôi luôn lưỡng lự nên sẽ không kịp hồ sơ, tôi sẽ bị gọi nvqs. Chắc chắn 1 thằng như tôi không sống nổi 2 tuần trong đấy.

Có lẽ lối thoát duy nhất của tôi bây giờ là 44 ","i'm very lucky i turn myself into a loser . hello everyone , tomorrow my college graduation ceremony now i can't happy because i'm actually a loser now . i think back myself , how many opportunity have i miss far just because i'm cowardly lazy . about education : i realize all my study from elementary school college , i never try my best , i still lucky get into a specialized school ( even though only a last - ditch ticket ). i lucky get into a top school , during time college i lazy , just hang out home playing game all day . i owe a lot subject ( 25 credit ), i still graduate time because i work hard during summer , teacher support me , use firework . =& gt ; a a result , i now have no professional knowledge all about work : i also do a few part - time job during my study . my family hanoi , i mainly work part - time get money go out pay fail subject , i only do random job didn't develop any skill . i also lucky get a job through a school affiliate a business ( 2 year contract , 1x million / month not include ) i quit after a few week because i need prepare study abroad a master's degree ( i will explain part below ). =& gt ; now i'm unemployed , stay home about love affection : i'm also very lucky always consider handsome . when i go work school , i get a lot girl talk me actively flirt , i'm also too stupid cowardly . =& gt ; i haven't have a relationship yet , i've never even hold a girl's hand now my parent have give me another chance study abroad a master's degree ( first i didn't agree my parent convince me go i wouldn't have go nvqs open up new opportunity have now pay deposit ) maybe i'm about throw opportunity away ! because i'm always hesitant , i won't able file time , i'll call nvqs . surely a guy like me couldn't survive 2 week there . maybe my only way out now 44",Normal

A few years ago, in the final exam for 10th grade in math, I had the honor of standing up because I was the person with the lowest score: 2 VND. Luckily, a teacher created the conditions to guide me into a private high school. Because it was a boarding school, I ate and slept there and was bullied. Rumors of me doing sensitive things made me very pressured and I asked to quit.  Also because I wanted to play, I didn't go to another school. My family had enough food and clothing, so I applied to work in many places, but because my parents were also old and expected me to come back and take over the small cafe. Life seemed to be peaceful, but many things happened. My father hired a maid and asked for a second wife while my mother was suffering from bone and joint disease. My dad forced me to choose to live with my dad or mom. I chose to go with my mom and found out that she also owed debt because the total number was 1.5 billion. Because pressure from the family came to destroy the shop, my mother and I were welcomed home with the condition of selling the land and paying off all the debt. The remaining 500 million is deposited in the bank and a few gold bars as a precaution. Some time later, my father passed away and told me to keep the coffee shop. After the epidemic period, the economy was difficult, my shop also suffered a loss of 50-100 million each year. Last year, my mother continued to report another 400 million in debt. I was really shocked but still took it out and paid it off. Nowadays, it will be difficult for the cafe to continue to support me and my mother if we get sick. If I want to work and study high school culture, I have to give up what my father built, leaving my mother alone at home when she's healthy and when she's sick.

Cũng vì ham chơi nên không đi học trường khác, nhà mình cũng gọi là đủ ăn đủ mặc nên mình có xin đi làm nhiều nơi nhưng vì bố mẹ cũng lớn tuổi mong mình về tiếp quản quán cà phê nhỏ, cuộc đời có vẻ an phận thì nhiều chuyện ập đến, bố mướn 1 cô giúp việc và đòi có vợ 2 trong lúc mẹ mình đang bệnh về xương khớp. Bố bắt mình chọn ở với bố hoặc mẹ, mình chọn theo mẹ thì phát hiện bà cũng thiếu nợ vì số đề tổng tới tận 1ty5. Vì áp lực từ dòng họ đến phá quán thì mình và mẹ được đón về nhà với điều kiện bán đất 2ty và trả hết nợ. Còn lại 500tr gửi ngân hàng và vài cây vàng để phòng. Một thời gian sau bố mình mất và dặn dò mình giữ quán cà phê, sau giai đoạn dịch thì kinh tế khó khăn quán mình cũng ế ẩm mỗi năm bù lỗ 50-100tr, năm trước mẹ lại tiếp tục báo nợ thêm 400tr, mình sốc thật sự nhưng vẫn rút ra trả hết. Nay cái quán cafe khó tiếp tục nuôi mình và mẹ nếu có bệnh tật. Mình muốn đi làm song song học nghề văn hóa cấp 3 thì phải bỏ những gì bố gây dựng, để cho mẹ 1 mình ở nhà lúc khỏe lúc ốm.

1mmp9da,1754848643.0,2025-08-10 17:57:23,"What is love? My family has 4 people, including my parents, my sister and me. It depends on the family not being separated, but from childhood to adulthood I have always kept the question of what is love, the love between parents and children. I always keep it in my heart and don't dare to confide in anyone because every time I tell it, my mother always says that if my parents don't love me, they won't raise me. And the next question is that in the future I will be a parent too, because I don't have a family yet so I don't understand my feelings. But is it true that if you raise your child, you will truly love him or her?
First is my father. He is the second child but takes on all the duties of his father's side. Even though he is hated by his father and uncle, he still cares for him with the view that he is just like his own child. He raised all of his family. His first aunt had 3 children, he passed away early, so his father took care of the money and took care of them. My first uncle and his wife divorced, and my cousin is my eldest nephew, so even my father's gambling debts are taken care of. There's nothing he doesn't worry about. My father is a man with a mindset of respecting men and not women. From childhood to adulthood, he never hugged or carried or took care of me. If I say it's love, I can't feel it. Because my niece was sick, my dad took care of me. But when my sister was sick, my dad didn't care. Even if my sister was sick and wanted to go see a doctor, my dad wouldn't let me go. My older sister was starting a business, so money wasn't very favorable. My dad even beat and cursed her severely for not agreeing to let her acquaintance's son work (she didn't agree because this guy worked hard and stole money). Until now, the grandchildren he took care of and raised loved him. My father was sick and didn't pay any attention. Even on Tet, he didn't even come to wish me anything. Not even a single word of thanks, not a single word of greeting. Even though he wholeheartedly took care of me, my grandchild even turned to ask for money to pay off his debt. No matter how bad they were, no matter how poorly they studied, my father still encouraged me to go to school. As for me, in my 2nd year, I was bullied by teachers and friends. Because of my poor academic performance (when this teacher retired and was old, he came to my house to apologize because he felt guilty for cheating on me), then he forced me to quit school 5 times 7 times.
As for my mother, she has the same opinion as my father, so she takes care of her children more attentively than her own children. She is willing to put up a house for her family to live on the street so that the children can have money to study abroad in the US. The grandchildren gave me old, torn scarves and praised them as precious treasures. If your biological child's things are better, you'll criticize them and throw them away. In addition, my family has an aunt who has epilepsy due to a big shock. Anyone who lives with someone who has epilepsy knows that living with them is very difficult. But my mother ignores her and lets her beat her two aunts when they get sick. If you protest, your mother will scold you. Her grandmother even gave her two children 4 gold bars as a dowry. because her cousins ​​were given land by her. My mother continued to arbitrarily take 3 gold bars to give to her cousin.  The remaining 1 tree will be sold to get money to take care of the children. Is this love? 
My parents are both people who earn money. Compared to both sides of my family, my parents always think that my two children are happier than their parents because they are not divorced. My family has money. But is that really the case? Parents want to spend more money than their children to take care of their grandchildren. They can save every penny or so. My two children even had to wear patched or old shirts from 15 or 20 years ago because they didn't have money. Even if they said they wanted to buy new clothes, their parents wouldn't let them and would beat them. also said that 2 ce broke of. I wonder if I have to keep it and raise it if I keep it and love it, or if I simply don't throw it away and can't do anything else? Not once did my parents defend my sister in front of another person even though it was the other party's fault. to the point where my grandmother once wondered why my parents treated me like that","Thế nào mới là tình yêu? Gia đình mình có 4 người.Gồm bố mẹ, chị gái và mình.Tùy gia đình không ly tán,nhưng từ bé tới lớn vẫn luôn giữ 1 câu hỏi thế nào là tình yêu, tình thương của bố mẹ với con cái.Mình luôn giữ trong lòng không dám tâm sự với ai vì mỗi lần kể ra mn đều bảo nếu bố mẹ k thương thì sẽ k nuôi mình lớn.Và câu tiếp theo là sau này mình làm bố làm mẹ cũng thế,do mình chưa có gđ nên k hiểu lòng bm. Nhưng liệu rằng cứ nuôi lớn là thương con yêu con thật ư ?
Đầu tiên là bố mình.Bố là con thứ nhưng gánh vác mọi vc của bên nội hoàn toàn.Dù bị ace và ôb nội ghét nhưng bố vẫn lo.Với quan điểm cháu cũng như con ruột.Ông nuôi lớn hết toàn bộ ace họ của mình.Bá Bác gái đầu có 3 ng con,bác bị K mất sớm nên bố lo tiền ,chăm nuôi các cháu. Bác trai đầu vs vợ ly dị, mà anh họ mình là cháu đích tôn nên kể cả nợ cờ bạc bố mình là chú vẫn lo hết.Ko vc gì bố k lo.Bố mình lại là ng có tư tưởng trọng nam khinh nữ, từ bé tới lớn chưa bao giờ bố ôm hay bế hay chăm sóc mình. Nếu nói đó là tình yêu tình thương thì mình ko cảm nhận đc. Vì cháu ốm thì bố mình lo đôn lo đáo.Nhưng chị gái hay mình ốm thì bố k thèm quan tâm.Thậm chí chị mình bị bệnh muốn đi khám bố cũng ko cho đi.Chị gái mình đang khởi nghiệp nên tiền bạc k thuận lợi lắm,bố mình còn đánh chửi rủa chị thậm tệ vì ko đồng ý cho con trai của ng quen vào làm(chị k đồng ý vì đứa này siêng ăn nhác làm còn trộm tiền). Cho tới bây giờ những đứa cháu mà ông chăm sóc nuôi nấng yêu quý.Bố mình ốm cno ko thèm quan tâm để ý,đến tết còn k thèm tới chúc.K 1 lời cảm ơn ko 1 lời hỏi thăm.Dù trc đó ông hết lòng chăm sóc.Đứa cháu đích tôn còn quay sang vòi tiền để trả nợ.Các ace họ dù có tệ cỡ nào ,học kém ra sao bố mình vẫn động viện đi học.Tới mình thì năm c2 bị gvcn trù và bạn bè batnat nên học  lực kém đi(gv này khi về hưu cao tuổi,đã sang tận nhà xl mình vì thấy áy náy do trù mình) thì ông 5 lần 7 lượt ép mình phải nghỉ học.
Đến mẹ mình thì cũng quan điểm giống bố nên chăm sóc cho các cháu tận tình hơn con ruột.Sẵn sàng cắm nhà cho gđ ra đường ở để cho các cháu có tiền đi du học ở Mỹ. Mấy đứa cháu tặng khăn cổ cũ,rách thì khen trân quý như bảo vật. Đồ của con ruột tốt hơn xịn hơn thì chê rồi vứt. Ngoài ra nhà mình có 1 dì bị ttpl do trc gặp cú sốc lớn.Ai ở với ng bị ttpl đều biết ở vs họ rất cực.Mà mẹ mình thì mặc kệ cho dì đánh đập 2 ce mình khi phát bệnh. Chỉ cần phản kháng là mẹ mình chửi. Thậm chí bà ngoại để cho 2 ce mình 4 cây vàng làm của hồi môn. Vì các em họ đã đc bà chia đất. Mẹ mình tiếp tục tự ý lấy 3 cây vàng đưa em họ.  Còn 1 cây thìbán đi lấy tiền chăm cho các cháu. Liệu đây có phải là tình yêu? 
Bố mẹ mình đều là ng kiếm đc tiền.So vs mn cả 2 bên nội ngoại.Bố mẹ luôn nghĩ 2 ce mình sung sướng hạnh phúc hơn các ace họ vì bố mẹ ko ly dị.Gđ có tiền. Nhưng có thật sự là thế?Bố mẹ vì chăm lo các cháu mà tiền bạc muốn bỏ ra vs con cái cũng keo kiệt hơn.Tiết kiệm đc xu nào hay xu ấy. 2 ce mình thậm chí từng phải mặc áo vá,áo cũ từ cách đây 15 20 năm do k có tiền.Có nói muốn mua quần áo mới bố mẹ cũng ko cho và đánh. Còn nói rằng 2 ce phá của. Mình tự hỏi phải chăng cứ nuôi là yêu là thương hay chỉ đơn giản ko vứt đi ko làm gì đc khác thì mới phải giữ lại nuôi? Chưa 1 lần bố mẹ bảo vệ chị em trc người khác dù đó là bên kia sai.

1oze189,1763379521.0,2025-11-17 11:38:41,"I plan to study another major after finishing my major at college. Hello everyone, I am currently 20 years old, next year in February I will be 21 years old. I'm a student nearing the final semester of college, I'm studying mechanical engineering at FPT college. By May (if nothing changes), I will graduate. After two years of studying here, I realized that I was not suitable for this major and other engineering majors. I realized that I initially liked studying social subjects. 

At the age of 18, although I did not have enough points to get into some social studies courses at universities in Hanoi, I had enough points to study some social studies subjects at schools in the province. At that time, I also had low self-esteem and was not confident in myself. Instead of retaking the exam or accepting a university degree in the province, I planned to work as a hired worker. My family objected and told me to continue studying. At that time, I was quite confused because I didn't know what major to choose. While surfing the internet at that time, I came across an advertisement for FPT Polytechnic College. At that time, I didn't know what major to choose and didn't research the profession thoroughly, plus the advertisement made me tempted to sign up. I chose IT major at this school without thinking carefully and without asking students who had studied this field. when I go to school. At first I enjoyed it quite a bit, but in the second week the lesson became more difficult. At that time, I still lacked confidence and didn't dare to ask, so the next week I didn't seem to have the motivation to study anymore. After finishing the course, I switched to another major, mechanical engineering. At first, I thought that studying here would be more leisurely because at that time I still believed that the school would have less theory and only practice and only learn how to use machines. It wasn't until I changed my major that I realized that the major here had few followers, and the service machines were limited. Because there are few people, I have to wait from January 2024 (second semester) until June 2024 before I can study. I thought everything was fine but it wasn't. And I just kept studying, studying in a boring way, without any motivation, even though I still studied well, didn't fail the subject, and the teachers tried hard to pass the subject, but I didn't feel comfortable studying at all. Then time passed until now.

I plan to study another major after finishing school. I also looked at other universities in Hanoi and also looked at things like studying for a second degree, transferring to another major or taking the HSA exam (competency assessment)... 

Anyone who has ever studied at university through a form such as a second degree, transfer to another major or retake the exam, etc. Then give me a review of these types of university education methods. Or do you have any other advice? I plan to study majors such as English language and pedagogy. 

Thanks for reading","Em định học ngành khác sau khi học hết ngành em học tại cao đẳng. Chào các bác, em hiện tại 20 tuổi, sang năm tháng 2 là em 21 tuổi. Em đang là sinh viên gần kỳ cuối của cao đẳng, em đang học ngành CNKT cơ khí tại Cao đẳng FPT. Đến tháng 5 (nếu không có gì thay đổi) thì em mới tốt nghiệp. Sau hai năm em học ở đây, em nhận ra là mình học không hợp ngành này và mấy ngành kỹ thuật khác. Em nhận ra là em ban đầu em thích học mấy môn xã hội. 

Cái năm 18 tuổi, tuy điểm không đủ vào mấy môn xã hội ở các trường đại học ở Hà Nội, nhưng đủ điểm để học mấy ngành xã hội ở trường trong tỉnh. Em lúc đó cũng hay tự ti, không tự tin vào bản thân mình, thay vì thi lại hoặc chấp nhận học trường đại học ở trong tỉnh thì em  dự định sẽ đi làm thuê. Gia đình phản đối và bảo em phải đi học tiếp, lúc đó em cũng khá mông lung vì không biết chọn ngành gì. Lúc đó có lướt mạng thì em có xem qua cái quảng cáo trường Cao đẳng FPT Polytechnic. Em lúc đó cũng chả biết lựa chọn ngành học gì và cũng không tìm hiểu kỹ nghề cộng thêm cái quảng cáo ý khiến em bị lùa gà mà vào đăng ký luôn. Em chọn đại ngành cntt ở trường này mà không suy nghĩ kĩ và không hỏi những người học đã từng học ngành này. Khi em xuống học. Em ban đầu khá thích thú, nhưng sang tuần thứ hai thì bài càng khó. Em lúc đó vẫn còn cái gì đó là thiếu tự tin và không dám hỏi, thế là sang tuần tiếp theo em dường như không còn động lực học nữa. Sau khi kết thúc môn học, em chuyển sang học ngành khác là CNKT cơ khí. Ban đầu em cứ nghĩ là học ở đây sẽ nhàn hơn vì lúc đó em vẫn tin là trường sẽ ít lý thuyết và chỉ thực hành và chỉ học cách dùng máy thôi. Đến khi em chuyển ngành học thì em mới nhận ra là ngành học ở đây thì ít người theo, máy móc phục vụ thì hạn chế. Đã thế vì ít người nên em phải đợi từ tháng 1 năm 2024 (kỳ thứ 2) cho đến tháng 6 năm 2024 thì em mới được học. Em cứ nghĩ mọi thứ vẫn ổn nhưng không. Và em cứ thế tiếp tục học, học một cách nhàm chán, không có động lực gì, dù vẫn học ổn, chưa nợ môn và thầy cô có chấm vất vát cho qua môn nhưng em thì không thấy thoải mái khi học cả. Rồi thời gian cứ thế trôi qua cho đến hiện tại.

Em dự định học xong em sẽ học ngành khác, em cũng có xem qua các trường đại học khác ở Hà Nội và cũng như mấy cái như học văn bằng hai, liên thông trái ngành hoặc thi HSA ( đánh giá năng lực)... 

Các bác nào đã từng học qua học lên đại học qua hình thức như văn bằng hai, liên thông trái ngành hoặc thi lại .v.v. rồi thì cho em review về mấy hình thức học lên đại học kiểu này. Hoặc có lời khuyên gì khác không ạ. Em dự định học ngành như ngôn ngữ anh, sư phạm.

1obkwj5,1760971837.0,2025-10-20 14:50:37,"Hello everyone, it's been a while since I've read everyone's posts here so now I want to share a little about myself. I (m21) am currently in my final year studying ATTT at PTIT. To talk about myself, it can be summed up in a few words: normal, normal to the point of mediocrity.  
**about family background:** My family is in the suburbs, we don't have any debt, but we don't have much money right now. My parents don't have a pension, their income is temporary, but my siblings support me so everything in the family is fine. I'm the only son, so I probably won't have any problems with housing in the future. In general, everything is normal.  
**About studying:** During the process from grade 1 to 12, I had a good academic record, ranked at the top of the class but nothing outstanding, without any awards. When I took the university entrance exam, I didn't know what I liked, so I kept applying for IT majors at many schools, and eventually passed the PTIT entrance exam.  
Because I had to study online, and I was still subjective in getting into university, I didn't focus on studying, so the first few semesters my results were quite poor (gpa about 2.2). From the following semesters, the results were also better, with one semester almost receiving a scholarship. Up to now, the gpa is over 3. And I just took the ielts test with 6.0, in general both scores are average (the good thing is that I don't have to retake the course or study to improve any subject).  
**about the members:** my relationship with my family is fine, everyone cares about each other. In terms of love, I have never loved anyone due to my shy personality (actually, it's much better now). Friends are not really close to anyone, most are at a social level.  
**about myself:** I don't often exercise, in my free time I play games, and spend money very sparingly (almost don't buy anything for myself). One strange thing is that I went to college by bus for 4 years with each trip taking about 2-3 hours, but the number of times I missed school in 4 years was only a few times (actually, the absence was because some teachers did not let me go to class when I was late, so I just skipped it). Because the schooling process was quite time-consuming as above and my family didn't lack anything, I didn't work any part-time jobs. It wasn't until my 4th year that I worked a random job in the wrong field, called experience and earned a little extra money.  
  
In short, with all of the above, I feel that I am at a normal level. The family has no debt, everyone is at peace, I haven't reported myself, I haven't failed the subject, that's already better than many people; However, looking up, there are many people who are much better than me, have internships, work in the right field, know what they like, have goals,... I still feel okay, I don't know how people feel about my ""normal"" life.  
(Actually, I recently realized that I should apply for an internship in the right industry early, but some companies' internship recruitment rounds have already passed :v)","Bình thường Xin chào mọi người, đọc bài của mọi người trong này cũng đã lâu nên nay cũng muốn chia sẻ một chút về bản thân. Mình (M21) hiện đang năm cuối ngành ATTT ở PTIT. Để mà nói về bản thân mình thì có thể gói gọn trong vài từ: bình thường, bình thường đến mức tầm thường.  
**Về gia cảnh:** gia đình mình ở ngoại thành, không nợ nần gì nhưng hiện tại cũng không dư giả gì nhiều. Bố mẹ mình không có lương hưu, thu nhập cũng tạm nhưng có các anh chị mình hỗ trợ nên mọi thứ trong gia đình vẫn ổn. Mình là con trai duy nhất nên vấn đề nhà ở trong tương lai chắc mình cũng không có vấn đề gì. Nói chung là mọi thứ bình thường.  
**Về học tập:** Trong suốt quá trình từ lớp 1 đến 12, mình có thành tích học tập ổn, đứng top đầu của lớp nhưng cũng không có gì nổi bật, không có bất cứ một giải thưởng gì. Đến khi thi đại học thì cũng không rõ mình thích gì nên cứ đăng ký các ngành về CNTT của các trường, cuối cùng đỗ vào ATTT của PTIT.  
Do phải học online, với cả vẫn chủ quan mới đỗ đại học nên mình cũng không tập trung vào học, vậy nên vài kỳ đầu kết quả khá kém (GPA khoảng 2.2). Từ những kỳ sau kết quả cũng tốt hơn, có kỳ suýt được học bổng. Đến bây giờ thì GPA cũng được hơn 3. với cả vừa thi IELTS được 6.0, nói chung cả 2 điểm đều ở mức trung bình (được cái là không phải học lại hay học cải thiện môn nào cả).  
**Về các mqh:** quan hệ của mình với gia đình ổn, mọi người đều quan tâm đến nhau. Chuyện tình cảm thì mình cũng chưa yêu ai do tính cách ngại giao tiếp (thực ra giờ đỡ nhiều rồi). Bạn bè thì không thân hẳn với ai, đa số ở mức xã giao.  
**Về bản thân:** mình không hay tập thể dục, lúc rảnh thì chơi game, tiêu tiền rất tiết kiệm (gần như không mua sắm gì cho bản thân). Có một điều khá dị đó là mình đã đi học đh bằng xe bus trong suốt 4 năm với mỗi lần đi mất khoảng 2-3 tiếng, thế nhưng số lần mình nghỉ học trong 4 năm chỉ có vài lần (thực ra nghỉ là do một số giáo viên không cho vào lớp khi đã đi muộn nên là đi lượn luôn). Do quá trình đi học khá mất thời gian như trên với cả gđ ko thiếu thốn gì nên mình cũng ko đi làm thêm gì, cho tới tận năm 4 mới đi làm thêm việc linh tinh ko đúng ngành, gọi là trải nghiệm và kiếm thêm ít tiền.  
  
Tóm lại là với tất cả những điều trên, mình cảm thấy bản thân đúng ở mức bình thường. Gđ ko nợ, mọi người yên ổn, bản thân ko báo, ko bị nợ môn, như vậy đã là hơn nhiều người; tuy nhiên nhìn lên thì cũng có nhiều người hơn mình rất nhiều, đã có chỗ thực tập, đi làm đúng ngành, biết bản thân thích gì, có mục tiêu,... Mình thì vẫn thấy ổn, còn không biết mọi người cảm nhận thế nào về cái cuộc sống ""bình thường"" của mình.  
(Thực ra gần đây mình mới ý thức được là nên xin đi thực tập đúng ngành sớm, nhưng mà qua hết đợt tuyển thực tập sinh của mấy cty rồi :v)","hello everyone , it's a while since i've read everyone's post here now i want share a little about myself . i ( m21 ) currently my final year study attt ptit . talk about myself , can sum up a few word : normal , normal point mediocrity . ** about family background :** my family suburb , we don't have any debt , we don't have much money right now . my parent don't have a pension , their income temporary , my sibling support me everything family fine . i'm only son , i probably won't have any problem housing future . general , everything normal . ** about study :** during process from grade 1 12 , i have a good academic record , rank top class nothing outstanding , without any award . when i take university entrance exam , i didn't know what i like , i keep apply major many school , eventually pass ptit entrance exam . because i have study online , i still subjective get into university , i didn't focus studying , first few semester my result quite poor ( gpa about 2 . 2 ). from follow semester , result also well , one semester almost receive a scholarship . up now , gpa over 3 . i just take ielts test 6 . 0 , general both score average ( good thing i don't have retake course study improve any subject ). ** about member :** my relationship my family fine , everyone care about each other . term love , i have never love anyone due my shy personality ( actually , it's much good now ). friend not really close anyone , most a social level . ** about myself :** i don't often exercise , my free time i play game , spend money very sparingly ( almost don't buy anything myself ). one strange thing i go college bus 4 year each trip take about 2 - 3 hour , number time i missed school 4 year only a few time ( actually , absence because some teacher do not let me go class when i late , i just skip ). because schooling process quite time - consuming a above my family didn't lack anything , i didn't work any part - time job . wasn't until my 4th year i work a random job wrong field , call experience earn a little extra money . short , all above , i feel i a normal level . family have no debt , everyone peace , i haven't report myself , i haven't fail subject , that's already good than many people ; however , look up , there many people who much good than me , have internship , work right field , know what they like , have goal ,... i still feel okay , i don't know how people feel about my "" normal "" life .

1hsoer9,1735916591.0,2025-01-03 15:03:11,"I lost nearly 40 million because of illness? Hello everyone, I study at a famous university in Ho Chi Minh City. In the high school exam, I had quite good results so I was lucky enough to receive a full 4-year scholarship from the school. At first, this was not the school I would choose, but because of the appeal of 4 years of free study plus a decent learning environment, I decided to choose this environment.

The first 2 years everything was quite smooth for me but things started to get worse in year 3.... I started working part-time on my free days, even working at night to help my family, so my health gradually deteriorated. My school is like other schools, if you miss attendance for more than 3 sessions, you will be banned from taking the exam. Unfortunately, because I paid tuition late, I couldn't register early this term, causing me to not learn anything for the first week, and I couldn't even register for a proper schedule. Everything won't be worth mentioning when I have to take a class from a famous and difficult teacher, and take the class on Monday mornings. The first week, almost no subjects took attendance, except for the teacher's subject, so I missed one day. Normally, on Monday mornings, I'm quite tired, so I usually come home about 45 minutes late, but I didn't know that the teacher didn't agree with that timeline, so I went to school late on the first day and got expelled, so I missed 2 meals. The first class is on Monday morning, and on Sunday night I have to work overtime, so I can't avoid the third missed class continuing to be jammed. After missing 3 classes, I told myself that I had to do whatever it took to get to school. I thought I would last like this until the end of the semester but, overworked, I fell ill, I had a high fever, to the point where I couldn't continue, I sent an email, took a photo of the time, took a thermometer, took a photo of my entire face and emailed it to the teacher hoping I could be legally absent but.... the teacher did not accept it because I was absent without a clear reason.......

So I missed 4 classes, on the last day of school, I was banned from taking the exam, 2 weeks of sending emails, talking face to face, but with a teacher ""the law is the law"", I couldn't save it anymore.... next term's tuition must be paid by myself, along with retake the course fees to be able to maintain the scholarship, which brought me nearly 40 million...., now I don't know what to do, I work all year just to save somewhere around 20..., again I don't dare to tell my family because I know that taking on this debt will only make it worse... I don't know if there is anyone here who offers installment loans... I would like to hand over my cccd or something so I can survive, but now I really can't think of any way...","Tớ mất gần 40 triệu vì bị bệnh? Chào mọi người, tớ học một trường đại học cũng có tiếng ở HCM, ở kì thi THPT, tớ có kết quả khá tốt nên được may mắn nhận được học bổng toàn phần 4 năm của trường. Thoạt đầu thì đây không phải là trường mà tớ sẽ chọn, nhưng vì sự hấp dẫn của việc 4 năm học không tốn tiền cộng với lại môi trường học tạm ổn, tớ đã quyết định chọn môi trường này.

2 năm đầu mọi thứ khá là suông sẻ với tớ nhưng mọi thứ bắt đầu tệ dần đi vào năm 3.... Tớ bắt đầu đi làm thêm vào những ngày rảnh, thậm chí làm cả ban đêm để phụ giúp gia đình,  sức khoẻ của tớ vì vậy mà dần bị bào mòn. Trường tớ cũng giống như những trường khác, nếu bị đánh vắng điểm danh trên 3 buổi thì sẽ bị cấm thi. Xui rủi thế nào, vì nộp học phí trễ, nên kì này tớ không đăng kí sớm được, khiến một tuần đầu tớ không học được gì, lại còn chả đăng kí được thời khoá biểu ra hồn nữa. Mọi thứ sẽ không có gì đáng nói khi mà tớ học phải lớp của một thầy khó mà có tiếng luôn, lại học vào sáng t2 nữa. Tuần đầu thì hầu như chả môn nào điểm danh cả, trừ môn của thầy, vậy là tớ vắng 1 bữa. Bình thường thì sáng t2 tớ khá mệt nên tớ thường lên muộn cỡ 45p, nhưng tớ không biết thầy lại không đồng ý với mốc thời gian đó, thế là hôm đầu tớ đi học trễ, bị đuổi về, vậy là tớ vắng 2 bữa. Tiết đầu vào sáng t2, tối chủ nhật lại phải xuyên đêm để làm thêm, cho nên tớ không tránh được việc buổi vắng thứ 3 tiếp tục bị ghẹt. Vắng 3 buổi, tớ tự nhủ lòng là phải làm mọi giá để lết đến trường. Những tưởng sẽ trụ được như vậy đến cuối kì NHƯNG, làm việc quá sức, tớ đã lăn ra bệnh, tớ sốt cao, đến mức k thể nào đi tiếp được, tớ gửi mail, chụp thời gian, chụp nhiệt kế, chụp cả mặt mình gửi mail cho thầy để mong bản thân có thể được vắng hợp lệ nhưng mà.... Thầy không chấp nhận với lí do là tớ vắng mà không có lí do rõ ràng.......

Vậy là tớ đã vắng 4 buổi, hôm cuối cùng đi học, tớ đã bị cấm thi, 2 tuần trời gửi mail, nói chuyện trực tiếp, nhưng với một người thầy ""luật là luật"" thì tớ chẳng cứu vãn được nữa.... việc học phí kì tới phải tự đóng, kèm theo phí môn học lại để có thể duy trì được học bổng đem tới cho tớ con số gần 40 triệu...., bây giờ tớ chả biết làm gì cả, cả năm đi làm chỉ để dành đc đâu đó 20..., lại chả dám nói với gia đình vì biết hoàn cảnh nhà mình gánh thêm cái nợ này chỉ thêm cực.... Không biết ở đây có bác nào cho vay trả góp k ạ,... em xin giao nộp cả cccd hay gì đó để có thể sống sót ạ, chứ bây giờ thật sự em k nghĩ được cách nào cả rồi...

A few years ago, I lived happily as a student. I had friends and was loved and cared for by my family, although my relationships were never good. But since entering high school, my family has become poor. Not the type of poor people, my parents had to work very hard and left me at home alone (even though it was comfortable, it was very lonely). My father is the source of my family's downfall. He drank, gambled, and was passionate about fish shooting :)) causing his family to fall into debt. from being an owner to being an employee, from being an employee to being unemployed. I was looking for a defense job for him, but after 2 months he started drinking again, argued with the other guy, and was expelled. I have to say that my insecurity towards men in particular and people in general largely comes from my father. He made my mother suffer, made the whole family suffer. I had to choose the path of quitting college to take care of my family later. He made me feel very sorry for myself and very self-conscious. 
Before something sad happened, I had friends by my side. But I've gradually lost connection since one of the group betrayed me. To be honest, I love my friends, they used to give me a very happy time, but then they didn't need me anymore, they gradually had other friends. It's a bit of a shame, but everyone has the right to choose friends with fewer problems. My connection with my friends is now just a few social sentences, and even if I have something to say, I'm not even asked. The loneliness and lack of something was always on my mind, for weeks and months. very very lonely.","Tuổi 18 và phải đối mặt với nỗi cô đơn, mất kết nối. Tôi là nữ, 18 tuổi. Là con út trong gia đình 4 chị em gái.Mấy năm trước tôi đã sống trong tuổi học trò cũng coi như vui vẻ, tôi có các bạn và được yêu thương, quan tâm bởi gđ, tuy các mqh tình cảm chưa bao giờ tốt đẹp. Nhưng từ khi lên cấp 3 cũng chính là lúc gia đình tôi trở nên túng thiếu. Không phải là kiểu nghèo xơ xác nma ba mẹ tôi phải làm thuê rất mệt và để tôi ở nhà 1 mình (tuy cũng thoải mái nhưng rất cô đơn). Ba tôi là nguồn cơn của sự lao dốc của gđ tôi. Ông rượu chè, cờ bạc, đam mê bộ môn bắn cá :)) khiến nhà t rơi vào nợ nần. Từ làm chủ thành làm công, từ làm công thành thất nghiệp. Tôi đã tìm việc bảo vệ cho ông nhưng được 2 tháng ông lại nhậu rồi cãi nhau với ngta rồi bị đuổi. Phải nói rằng nỗi bất an của tôi dành cho đàn ông nói riêng và con người nói chung phần lớn xuất phát từ ba tôi. Ông làm cho mẹ tôi khổ, làm cho cả gia đình khổ. Tôi phải chọn con đường  nghỉ học đại học để sau này gánh vác gia đình. Ông làm tôi rất tủi thân, rất tự ti. 
Trước đó xảy ra chuyện gì buồn thì tôi cũng có bạn bè bên cạnh. Nhưng tôi lại mất kết nối dần từ khi một đứa trong nhóm phản bội. Nói thật là tôi yêu thương bạn tôi, tụi nó từng cho t khoảng thời gian rất hạnh phúc, nhưng sau đó tụi nó lại không cần tôi nữa, họ dần có bạn bè khác. Cũng hơi trách nhưng mà ai cũng có quyền lựa chọn bạn bè ít vấn đề hơn. Sợi dây kết nối của tôi với bạn bè giờ chỉ là vài câu xã giao, đến tôi có chuyện còn không được hỏi thăm. Nỗi cô đơn, thiếu vắng gì đó luôn ở trong tâm trí tôi, nhiều tuần, nhiều tháng. Rất rất cô đơn.","18 year old facing loneliness disconnection . i female , 18 year old . i young child a family 4 sister . a few year ago , i live happily a a student . i have friend love care my family , although my relationship never good . since enter high school , my family have become poor . not type poor people , my parent have work very hard leave me home alone ( even though comfortable , very lonely ). my father source my family's downfall . he drink , gamble , passionate about fish shoot :)) cause his family fall into debt . from an owner an employee , from an employee unemployed . i look a defense job him , after 2 month he start drink again , argue other guy , expel . i have say my insecurity towards men particular people general largely come from my father . he make my mother suffer , make whole family suffer . i have choose path quit college take care my family later . he make me feel very sorry myself very self - conscious . before something sad happen , i have friend my side . i've gradually lose connection since one group betray me . honest , i love my friend , they use give me a very happy time , then they didn't need me anymore , they gradually have other friend . it's a bit a shame , everyone have right choose friend few problem . my connection my friend now just a few social sentence , even if i have something say , i'm not even ask . loneliness lack something always my mind , week month . very very lonely .",Depression

I did some research and found out that a master's degree takes 1 year and a doctorate takes 3 years
The reason I went wasn't because I liked it, my dad was afraid I wouldn't be competitive enough in the country so he dragged me abroad to get a degree.. 
I studied at an average school and got a good degree. Don't fail the subject and graduate on time. 
I also love a classmate from high school, we have been in love for more than 3 years...

My family is also normal, with enough food and all the money for me to study abroad... my father said it would be best if I could stay there or else I would return home, but I'm afraid that getting my degree won't be enough... 
2. I love a pedagogy classmate, he's very nice, the date to marry, traditional style is exactly my style huhu. But your family has a bit of a problem (my parents say so), they work in small businesses, not in the government like my parents.

I owe all the subjects of semester 1. and currently have the possibility of owing 2 more subjects of semester 2.

I went to school in the first semester, but my class felt quite different from the 3rd semester. The environment was too relaxed, so I complacently skipped class, then lost basic knowledge. I also don't have any classmates so I can't ask how things are going or how the homework is going. And in the industry, I can only play with 1-2 friends.

Currently, I'm studying FTU, ielts 7.5 (expired), GPA is not high (3.0 round), because in 3rd year I can't aim with xs, so my immediate goal is to graduate with a good degree. 
In addition, I also work as a teaching assistant for a center in Vietnam. The rate is also low but the job is gentle enough for me to have some pocket money + focus my time on studying.
In my first year, I joined a hobby club so I didn't learn much about any major, didn't participate in any competitions, didn't do research (unless it was a required subject for research),... 
In my second year, I still went to school, combined working 2 jobs at home + crocheting wool at home,... ncl was enough for me to feel ""safe"" even though it was a bit bare minimum (didn't fail the subject, didn't ask my parents for money to deduct tuition), and in my free time, I went out with friends.
By the 3rd year, I started to feel a lot of pressure, people around me said that if you had an internship or a dual degree, you would have an income of xx/month 😭
Should I have a direction in my third year so that I can graduate less hard in the future? 🥺 I'm planning to learn more Chinese, do an internship in the summer,...
And kb, what kind of job do graduate students usually do? I'm still quite confused about my career direction (before, I only went into KTĐN because I was qualified + my parents wanted me to, my interests were more artistic).

The prequel is quite long, so I'll summarize: my father was overly patriarchal, miserable, cowardly, and a psychopath. He just wants his face to be beautiful compared to society, his wife and children just need to fulfill their duties as a ""happy home"" with ""the husband is the best, no matter what class the husband is"" and don't care. So my family is in a situation where 1 is poor and 2 is that I'm stuck with this house, because when I was 18 I was threatened to go to college near home without being able to follow my wishes, having to be a ""good and good student"" only studying and coming home to help with the housework, not being able to go anywhere (not even go out to work) so that he could show off to his friends (yes, this is partly because I was too stupid back then, didn't know how to fight). There were even times when he gave me work right when I was/was about to study and take exams. No matter how much he told me, I still missed a few subjects during the covid break to study at home (his opinion ""sitting in front of the computer is just playing and not studying""). Fast forward to the 3rd year now, of course because my family is poor, I have to stay at home + because I failed the subject, my husband looks at me like an animal. In general, we argue a lot, mainly cursing at me but also cursing at my wife and children as ""animals"" and ""libbers"" - in general, he doesn't consider my wife and children as human beings. But thanks to that, I went to apply for a job outside, but he didn't stop me anymore (but still didn't care about my finances). Currently, I am also trying to find a way to be independent and leave this house, avoiding having to face each other with my father again.  


Unfortunately, yesterday, my class had an online meeting. I was in the middle of doing some work for him when I saw that he was coming. I called into the workshop and told him that I was coming back for the meeting. 15 minutes later, while I was reading documents, my dad suddenly ran home (I don't have my own room, my desk is in the living room, I sleep on the ground with blankets) cursing and cursing, saying it's all work so you should bring your ass home, and then got dirty and threw things around and hit my dog. He saw me sitting on the computer, regardless of whether I was playing or studying, I ran straight to the wifi station to unplug the power + cable. I'm also very fed up with it, I plan to get up and pull it back to plug it in to finish the meeting (he did it every time he had the wifi connection during his period, I'm used to it, I'm also healthier now than the account that is more addicted to alcohol and drugs than food, so I'm not too scared). How about this time when I touched the wifi, he shouted ""What are you going to do? Are you going to hit me?"" r kept repeating like a transmitter about 3 or 4 times. When I snatched the wifi and plugged it in, he was like ""you're a criminal. Let me call the police and take you to jail."" I didn't do anything to him, just let him go. He was so angry that he couldn't do anything and went back to the factory.  


But when I thought about it, I found it strange, so I came here to ask. bth was confused about life, now I'm even more confused. From then until now, other than a few pleasantries with my uncle, my cousin, and the neighbors, my father and I didn't say a word to each other. Because bth was often annoyed with each other, he rarely spoke, so I don't know if he was rude to me (more than bth) or if he cursed me and then came back to bth.

Thế nên nhà em h lâm vào cảnh 1 là nghèo 2 là em bị mặc kẹt với cái nhà này, do hồi 18 em bị đe phải học đh ở gần nhà mà ko đc theo nguyện vọng của mình, phải làm ""con ngoan trò giỏi"" chỉ có học vs về nhà phụ việc nhà, ko đc đi đâu (kể cả ra ngoài đi làm) để lão đi khoe vs ae bạn bè (Dạ vâng, cái này cũng 1 phần do em hồi đấy ngu ngơ quá, ko biết đấu tranh). Thậm chí lắm lúc lão són việc ra cho em đúng những lúc em đang/sắp học với thi, nói mãi lão mới thôi mà em cũng lỡ khoảng mấy môn đợt nghỉ covid học ở nhà (quan điểm của lão ""ngồi trc máy tính là chỉ có chơi ko có học""). Tua đến hiện tại năm 3, tất nhiên do nhà nghèo nên em hiện đag phải nghỉ ở nhà + do nợ môn nên h lão nhìn em như nhìn súc vật, nói chung cãi cọ cũng nhiều, chủ yếu chửi em là chính những cũng chửi cả vợ con là ""súc vật"", ""lũ nợ"" - nói chung ko coi vợ con là con người. Cơ mà cũng nhờ thế nên em đi xin vc ngoài, lão cũng kệ chẳng có ngăn nữa (nhưng mà vẫn ko coi tk con ra gì). Hiện tại thì e cũng đang cố gắng tìm cách để tự lập r thoát ly ra khỏi cái nhà này, tránh ko phải chạm mặt nhau vs bố e nữa  


Số là hôm qua, bên lớp em có cuộc họp online, em đag làm dở vc cho lão thì thấy đến h, có gọi vọng vào xưởng bảo lão là em về họp. 15p sau, đag ngồi đọc tài liệu thì tk bố e đùng đùng chạy về nhà (em ko có phòng riêng, bàn học ở phòng khách, ngủ thì rải chăn ra ngủ đất luôn) chửi nhăng chửi cuội lên, bảo là việc đầy ra mà mày xách đít mày về, xong r cáu bẩn quăng quật đồ đạc, đánh con chó nhà em. Lão thấy em ngồi máy, chả cần biết là chơi hay học, chạy thẳng ra cục wifi rút điện + cáp. Em thì cũng ngán ngẩm lắm r, tính dậy giựt lại cắm để họp cho nó xong (cái quả giựt wifi mấy lần lão đến kỳ cũng làm r, em cũng quen, e bây h cũng khỏe hơn cái tk nghiện rượu vs thuốc hơn đồ ăn nên cũng ko sợ mấy). Thế nào lần này em vừa chạm vào cục wifi, lão la toáng lên ""MÀY ĐỊNH LÀM CÁI GÌ? M ĐÁNH TAO À?"" r cứ lặp đi lặp lại như cái máy phát khoảng 3 4 lần gì đấy. Lúc em giựt đc wifi, cắm lên thì lão lại kiểu ""M LÀ TK TỘI ĐỒ. ĐỂ T GỌI CÔNG AN TỐNG M VÀO TÙ"". Em chả động gì đến lão, cứ kệ tk già tức ko làm đc gì quay về xưởng.  


Cơ mà h em ngồi ngẫm lại thì cũng thấy là lạ, nên em mới lên đây hỏi. Bth đã hoang mang về cuộc đời bây h em lại càng hoang mang hơn. Từ lúc đấy đến h ngoài mấy câu xã giao với ô chú, ô anh họ em vs mấy người hàng xóm thì e vs bố cũng chả nói vs nhau câu nào, bth do hay khó chịu vs nhau nên cũng ít nói nên e cũng chả biết là lão cạch mặt em (hơn bth) hay là lão chửi cho có xong quay lại bth

10efyov,1673971733.0,2023-01-17 16:08:53,"disappointment instead of regret, oh my god! I'm Vietnamese, but I'm quite skeptical about Vietnamese football (at best I tend to be cautiously optimistic), and have been like that since Vietnam U22 lost to Thailand in Sea Games 29 in 2017. Coach Park Hang Seo is very legendary, so I know and respect him for bringing Vietnamese football to the top over the past 5 years, with Vietnam U23 achieving quite a lot of success in recent years (we I, most Vietnamese people, know that), but... (warning: long article ahead)

To summarize: he has his team, who is expected to defeat Thailand in the end in the 2022 AFF Mitsubishi Cup, because it will be a tribute to his own career. yes, that's right, aff cup 2022 (I call aff cup from then on as aff20xx, abbreviated here as: aff2022), and Vietnam u23 largely had surprisingly impressive performances.  Most notably, the 0-0 draw against (u23) Singapore in the first leg of the semi-finals, and the 2-0 win in the second leg (which took place at a rather cramped My Dinh stadium), with a total score of 2-0, completely defeating that team. Thailand has long been Vietnam's most notable opponent, and Thailand's u23 previously flourished under the special leadership of Thailand's messi (I intentionally forgot his name, please guess), and then some other great players, with them having defeated Vietnam in the semi-finals (total score 3-2 for Thailand vs. Vietnam), then won the aff2020 championship, one aff season after Vietnam's championship in aff2018. The fact that Vietnam almost won the U23 Asia 2018 championship still makes me skeptical, and so does the fact that they cannot qualify for the 2022 world cup. But after that, Vietnam u23 developed strongly, won 2 consecutive gold medals, and seemed to win the 2022 Asiad, but they lost in the quarterfinals.

The debts are as follows: Vietnam won aff2008 (under another great coach whose name I forgot), king's cup 2019, sea games 30 (2019) and 31 (2022), and aff2018.  Thailand won the aff2020 championship and defeated Coach Park Hang Seo for the first time since the above mentioned aff and after the upstream defeat in the above mentioned aff2008. So, both teams led by park hang seo (vn) and alexandre polking (th) tried to pay back their debt from then on and so on. However, aff2022 is Mr. Parks' last tournament during his tenure with U23 Vietnam, so it is even more personal. (I will tell later.)

Unlike Vietnam for most of the tournament, Thailand faced many difficulties for most of the season, such as drawing with Indonesia in the group stage and losing 0-1 to Malaysia in the first leg of the semi-finals. Then suddenly polking became classy, and successfully applied it to help the whole team compete more effectively with methodical play and better tactics, helping Thailand crush Malaysia 3-0 in the second leg of the aff2022 semi-finals, being able to repay the debt of the miracle of sea games 30 and 31 and aff2008, a maximum of 15 years apart (sea games 24 from 2007: Vietnam failed in the final and only won a silver medal).

back to the game, i watched almost the entire aff2022 final (read: both legs, almost the entire match each, giving up or making up extra minutes for each match!). There, Thailand, under the guidance of Polking, shone. And the goalkeeper Van Hau and some of his friends were messy, leaving the players alone. (I forgot the name again) assisted and/or made a successful shot, leading to the first goal lost for Vietnam, after the goal the goal was not removed for the rest of aff 2022!  Vietnam suddenly went from being overwhelmed to being overwhelmed by Thailand, almost losing the first leg only to have a 2-2 draw because Van Lam excellently performed a trick shot into the opponent's net, and the aforementioned goalkeeper almost put the ball out of the way in the third possible time in the last seconds... literally. It all took place on My Dinh Stadium, which is in the process of being restored and renovated (the same stadium where Vietnam won against Indonesia in the semi-finals). arrived at the stadium in bangkok, where the second leg took place, and oh my god, vietnam was more boring. Most of the problems they encountered from round 1 were doubled because not only did the accumulated number of goals, 2 goals conceded by Thailand, but the Vietnamese players also played weaker, while Thailand not only had the same brilliant performance as before but also actually took advantage of the home field advantage and technically surpassed Vietnam!  still t.b's goal. in the 24th minute, and... well, park hang seo may have ruined any remaining hope, while polking will be able to applaud when the match ends with a score of 0-1 in favor of thailand, ending 3-2 vn and sending u23 thailand to receive the championship trophy from fif","Thất vọng thay vì tiếc nuối Giời ơi! Tôi là người Việt Nam, nhưng tôi khá hoài nghi với bóng đá Việt Nam (tốt nhất tôi từng có xu hướng lạc quan thận trọng), và đã như vậy kể từ khi U22 Việt Nam thấy bại trước Thái Lan ở SEA Games 29 vào năm 2017. Huấn luyện viên Park Hang Seo rất huyền thoại, nên tôi mới biết và tôn trọng ông ấy vì đã đưa bóng đá Việt Nam lên đỉnh cao trong hơn 5 năm qua, cùng U23 Việt Nam gặt hái khá nhiều thành công như những năm gần đây (chúng tôi, những người dân Việt Nam hầu hết đều biết điều đó), nhưng... (Cảnh báo: bài dài phía trước)

Tóm tắt lại: Ông ấy có đội của mình, những người được cho là sẽ đánh bại Thái Lan chung cuộc ở AFF Mitsubishi Cup 2022, bởi vì đó sẽ là một sự tri ân cho sự nghiệp của chính mình. Vâng, đúng vậy, AFF Cup 2022 (tôi gọi AFF Cup từ đó như AFF20xx, viết tắt ở đây là: AFF2022), và U23 Việt Nam phần lớn đã có màn trình diễn ấn tượng đến bất ngờ.  Đáng chú ý nhất là trận hòa 0-0 trước (U23) Singapore ở lượt đi bán kết, và thắng 2-0 ở lượt về (diễn ra trên sân Mỹ Đình khá chật chội), với tổng tỷ số 2-0, hoàn toàn đánh bại đội đó. Thái Lan từ lâu đã là đối thủ đáng chú ý nhất của Việt Nam, và U23 Thái Lan trước đây đã phát triển mạnh mẽ dưới sự dẫn dắt đặc biệt của Messi của Thái Lan (tôi cố tình quên tên anh ấy, xin đoán), và sau đó là một số cầu thủ vĩ đại khác, với việc họ đã từng đánh bại Việt Nam ở bán kết  (tổng tỷ số 3-2 cho Thái Lan vs. Việt Nam), rồi vô địch AFF2020, một mùa AFF sau chức vô địch của Việt Nam ở AFF2018. Việc Việt Nam suýt vô địch U23 châu Á 2018 vẫn làm tôi hoài nghi, và việc họ không thể vượt qua vòng loại World Cup 2022 cũng vậy. Nhưng sau đó, U23 Việt Nam đã phát triển mạnh mẽ, giành 2 huy chương vàng liên tiếp, và tưởng chừng sẽ vô địch ASIAD 2022, nhưng họ lại thua ở tứ kết.

Những món nợ như sau: Việt Nam vô địch AFF2008 (dưới thời một HLV vĩ đại khác mà tôi quên tên), King's Cup 2019, SEA Games 30 (2019) và 31 (2022), và AFF2018.  Thái Lan vô địch AFF2020 và là lần đầu đánh bại HLV Park Hang Seo kể từ AFF nói trên và sau thất bại ngược dòng ở AFF2008 nêu trên. Vì vậy, cả hai đội do Park Hang Seo (VN) và Alexandre Polking (TH) dẫn dắt đều cố gắng trả lại món nợ của mình từ đó và như vậy. Tuy nhiên, AFF2022 là giải đấu cuối cùng của ông Park trong nhiệm kỳ của ông với U23 Việt Nam, nên nó càng mang tính cá nhân hơn. (Tôi sẽ cho biết ở sau.)

Không như Việt Nam trong phần lớn của giải, Thái Lan gặp nhiều khó khăn trong phần lớn thời gian của mùa giải, như hòa Indonesia ở vòng bảng và thua Malaysia 0-1 ở bán kết lượt đi. Rồi tự dưng Polking trở nên đẳng cấp, và đã thành công vận dụng nó để giúp toàn đội thi đấu hiệu quả hơn với lối chơi bài bản và chiến thuật tốt hơn, giúp Thái Lan đè bẹp Malaysia 3-0 ở lượt về bán kết AFF2022, có thể trả lại nợ kỳ tích SEA Games 30 và 31 và AFF2008, cách nhau tối đa 15 năm (SEA Games 24 từ 2007: Việt Nam thất bại ở trận chung kết và chỉ giành được huy chương bạc).

Trở lại với trận đấu, tôi đã xem hầu hết toàn bộ trận chung kết AFF2022 (đọc là: cả hai lượt trận, mỗi lượt gần như toàn bộ trận đấu, nhường hoặc bù thêm phút cho mỗi trận đấu!). Ở đó, Thái Lan, dưới sự dẫn dắt của Polking, đã tỏa sáng. Còn thủ môn Văn Hậu và 1 số bạn lộn xộn, để cầu thủ T.B. (em quên tên lại quên) hỗ trợ và/hoặc thực hiện cú sút thành công, dẫn đến bàn thua đầu tiên cho Việt Nam, sau bàn thua không gỡ  mục tiêu cho phần còn lại của AFF 2022!  Việt Nam bất ngờ từ áp đảo chuyển sang bị Thái Lan áp đảo, suýt thua trận lượt đi chỉ có được tỷ số hòa 2-2 do Văn Lâm đã xuất sắc thực hiện tiểu xảo sút tung lưới đối phương, còn thủ môn nói trên thì suýt chút nữa đưa bóng ra khỏi vào lần 3 có thể xảy ra vào những giây cuối cùng... theo đúng nghĩa đen. Tất cả diễn ra trên sân Mỹ Đình đang trong quá trình phục hồi và cải tạo (cũng chính là sân mà Việt Nam đã thắng Indonesia ở bán kết). Đến sân vận động ở Bangkok, nơi diễn ra trận lượt về, và ôi giời ơi, Việt Nam đã chơi chán hơn. Hầu hết các vấn đề mà họ gặp phải từ lượt 1 gấp bội bởi không chỉ số bàn thắng tích lũy, bị Thái Lan sút lưới 2 bàn, mà các cầu thủ VN còn chơi nhạt nhòa hơn, trong khi Thái Lan không chỉ có phong độ chói sáng như xưa mà còn  đã thực sự tận dụng được lợi thế sân nhà và vượt qua Việt Nam về mặt kỹ thuật!  Vẫn là bàn thắng của T.B. ở phút 24, và... chà, Park Hang Seo có thể đã phá hỏng mọi hy vọng còn sót lại, trong khi Polking sẽ có thể vỗ tay khi trận đấu kết thúc với tỷ số 0-1 nghiêng về Thái Lan, chung cuộc TH 3-2 VN và đưa U23 Thái Lan lên nhận cúp vô địch từ FIFA, để lại một tấm huy chương thường còn rất ấn tượng cho những chiến binh rồng áo đỏ.

Hãy nói về con voi đầu tiên trong phòng (ý định chơi chữ?): Park Hang Seo đã vô ý làm mất hiệu quả các cầu thủ của đội mình, không chỉ vì chiến lược của ông trở nên quá dễ đoán đối với một người rất giỏi về bóng đá như Thái Lan (cụ thể là cho Polking), mà còn của ông. cách ông ấy thực sự đã gây rối và/hoặc thậm chí phản tác dụng với các cầu thủ của anh ấy, đồng thời làm phong độ sa sút, đặc biệt là khi các cầu thủ hầu như đã sa sút phong độ nữa. Và việc ông Park cầm quân trên sân Thái Lan còn làm mọi thứ tệ hơn, vì trong đó Việt Nam buộc phải chống chọi với thời tiết nắng nóng hơn, cộng với sân chơi quá khác càng khiến mọi thứ trở nên tồi tệ hơn. Theo cách mà họ có được, cuối cùng họ đã đánh mất cơ hội ghi bàn để phản công bất kỳ cơ hội nào của Thái Lan, do đó, làm để thua trận lượt về, và do là trận chung kết nên làm mất chức vô địch của họ.  Mặt khác, Thái Lan ở đẳng cấp khác vì Polking đã đảm bảo những cầu thủ còn lại rất tốt, bù đắp cho sự vắng mặt của hai cầu thủ xuất sắc nhất của họ, và cuối cùng là giúp kiểm soát lối chơi. Họ đột nhiên trở thành kiệt tác tập thể sau những khó khăn ban đầu, và con đường của họ đã được đền đáp. Đặc biệt là ở sân của Bangkok kể từ chặng 2.

 Con voi thứ hai trong phòng tất nhiên là... ai đang cổ vũ?  Sân Mỹ Đình có 40.000 suất, sân Bangkok 20.000, mặc dù Thái Lan bị từ chối yêu cầu 50.000 suất vì mặt sân tệ hơn sân Mỹ Đình giữa AFF2022. Dù bằng cách nào, rất nhiều người hâm mộ đã cổ vũ cho đội của họ. Tôi biết rằng có vài triệu người nữa, nhưng chỉ vài chục nghìn người có thể phù hợp với một sân vận động như thế này, và cách hiệu quả nhất là cổ vũ... trực tiếp, không phải từ internet.  Và chừng nào đã được chứng minh, và đúng như dự định từ sự hoài nghi của tôi, tinh thần và sự cổ vũ thôi là chưa đủ. Làm việc theo nhóm phải hiệu quả và đi cùng với chiến lược tốt, sức mạnh tổng hợp, cầu thủ chơi tốt và cơ sở hạ tầng được tối ưu hóa có thể và có xu hướng đi một chặng đường dài giữa chiến thắng và thất bại trong bóng đá (hay còn gọi là bóng đá, không phải bóng đá từ Super Bowl).  Và mặc dù Việt Nam không thua kém về sức mạnh và tinh thần đồng đội, nhưng... những kết quả thực sự quan trọng đã nói lên sự thực. (Tất cả điều này đúng với toàn bộ bóng đá) Nhân tiện, bạn có chắc chắn rằng Việt Nam thỉnh thoảng sẽ trở thành nhà vô địch không? Ơ? Chưa chắc vậy.

Chỉ riêng hai thứ này này thôi cũng đủ để chứng minh rằng AFF2022 đã trở thành một giải đấu thất bại với Việt Nam, vì không giành được cúp vô địch họ cần và buộc phải nhận huy chương, thường thì điều đó sẽ rất ấn tượng, vì việc lọt vào các trận chung kết thực sự không bao giờ dễ dàng đến thế (đặc biệt là đối với World Cup). Như vậy, vị trí á quân, thế mà... Park dự định giành chức vô địch, như một sự tri ân, bởi đó là trận đấu cuối cùng của ông. Vì vậy, chiến thắng chung cuộc của Thái Lan có nghĩa là Polking đã bôi nhọ ông Park, như vậy không thể tồi tệ về tổng thể nếu không phải vì những gì đã giải thích ở điểm đầu tiên trên voi (ý định chơi chữ? Một lần nữa?) Tôi đã đề cập ở trên. Phần lớn sự bế tắc và lo sợ của tuyển Việt Nam ở chung kết AFF 2022 bắt nguồn từ cách ông Park huấn luyện đội tuyển của mình sau SEA Games 31. Những cầu thủ Việt Nam trực tiếp tham dự VCK AFF 2022, tức là những người chơi trong bất kỳ trận đấu nào, không những phong độ sa sút bất ổn, mà còn mắc quá nhiều lỗi mà không sửa kịp, để cho Thái Lan soán ngôi như những kiệt tác xứng đáng là những gì tốt nhất mà Việt Nam có được cho đến thời điểm đó.  Polking ở AFF2022 đã làm được những gì mà Việt Nam đã làm được ở AFF2008 và Park đã làm được trước AFF2022, và đó là điều đáng ghen tị nhưng đáng học hỏi. Đây là mùa giải cuối cùng của Park trong nhiệm kỳ của U23 Việt Nam, và ông và Polking đã quyết định trả thất bại cho nhau (như đã đề cập ở trên), vì vậy trận hòa của Thái Lan rồi chiến thắng tối thiểu đã trả món nợ từ Việt Nam ở AFF2008, King's Cúp 2019 và SEA Games 30, 31!  Và điều đó không hề tốt vì báo tin Thái Lan từng tuyên bố rằng bất cứ ai thắng trận đấu này sẽ trở thành số 1 mới của Đông Nam Á, vì vậy điều đó thành ra là Thái Lan thực sự đã trở lại vị trí số 1 của họ cho Đông Nam Á, sau khi bị buộc phải nhìn Park làm nên thành công cho U23 Việt Nam sau thất bại thảm hại của U22 Việt Nam tại SEA Games 29!

Bởi vậy, cái này không hề tiếc nuối mà là một cái kết vô cùng hụt hẫng và đáng quên cho hành trình huyền thoại của HLV Park Hang Seo cùng U23 Việt Nam. Thật khó để không cảm thấy thương cảm cho ông, nhưng cũng quá khó để không trách mắng ông ngay tại chỗ vì sự bướng bỉnh và lỗi sai của ông ấy đã phá hỏng sự ra đi của ông ấy bằng cách khiến đội tuyển ấy bất ngờ bị đánh bại lần cuối. Đó là lý do tại sao chúng ta cần phải mắng Park Hang Seo ngay giờ, nhưng điều đó không có nghĩa là tôi đã đánh mất sự tôn trọng dành cho ông Park (thực tế là bạn không nên như vậy). Park Hang Seo là huyền thoại, ông đã thực sự cứu bóng đá Việt Nam ta đã có, dù sự can thiệp ngoan cố của ông đã trở nên thất vọng đến mức đáng buồn khi đưa Việt Nam đến bờ vực trở lại vết xe đổ và sự bế tắc vô vọng sau thất bại của U22 Việt Nam trong năm 2017! Như vậy, AFF2022 trở thành giải đấu tồi tệ nhất mà ông Park từng phải trải qua với U23 Việt Nam, bởi một trận long trời lở đất! (Cái giải kém nhất hoà giữa chung kết U23 châu Á 2018 và vòng loại World Cup 2022 xếp sau từ giai đoạn 3)

 Giờ đây, ông Park Hang Seo không còn là huấn luyện viên trưởng của đội tuyển bóng đá quốc gia Việt Nam, xin tạm biệt ông và chúc ông sống lâu, mạnh khỏe, hạnh phúc với niềm vui của riêng mình. Tuy nhiên, đã đến lúc một kỷ nguyên kết thúc, và bóng đá Việt Nam rất, rất, rất cần một HLV kế nhiệm, tốt hơn, có thể giúp đội tuyển (lúc này chủ yếu là U23) tiến tới chức vô địch tốt hơn.  'được cho là xứng đáng, giống như Park ban đầu đã làm trong 5 năm trước khi đăng bài này.  Một người nào đó ít nhất là thông minh và tốt như vậy, nhưng có thể thích nghi tốt hơn.  Và các đội cũng cần có những thay đổi, điều chỉnh để không chỉ thích ứng với HLV mà cả tương lai của họ, kể cả giấc mơ dự World Cup. Một kỷ nguyên mới đang chờ đón, và tôi hy vọng Việt Nam sẽ không dễ rơi vào vết xe đổ của SEA Games 29 và AFF 2022 đâu.","disappointment instead regret , oh my god ! i'm vietnamese , i'm quite skeptical about vietnamese football ( best i tend cautiously optimistic ), have like since vietnam u22 lose thailand sea game 29 2017 . coach park hang seo very legendary , i know respect him bring vietnamese football top over past 5 year , vietnam u23 achieve quite a lot success recent year ( we i , most vietnamese people , know ), ...

1bxtqfe,1712458296.0,2024-04-07 02:51:36,"Should I continue studying for a master's degree or retake the university entrance exam? Hello everyone. I'm a male born in 2002. Currently, I am a final year student majoring in mechatronics at Hanoi Polytechnic University. Although I am not a very excellent student, my academic results are still okay (27.35 points in block A00 in 2020 and current cpa is about 3.4 - excellent degree). This term, I am currently working on my bachelor's degree thesis to graduate and expect to graduate in July. Previously, when choosing a major to take the university entrance exam, I also listened to the admission advice from teachers and schools and found that the mechatronics major was quite good and interesting. Furthermore, hust is also a famous technical school, so going out to work in the future will be more convenient. When I went to university, the first 2 years were mainly about general subjects, so I also studied hard to get high scores, but I didn't have a very clear path. But when I reached 3rd year, I started with the basic subjects of the industry, so I started applying to the research labs of the teachers in the department so that I could understand what I would actually do in this industry. It was at that time that I realized that I had no passion for such jobs and was quite confused about what I would do when I graduated. Even so, when I joined the lab, I still worked hard to learn experience from my colleagues and also won a prize in a scientific research competition at school because I thought I should just try to make my profile a little nicer and then think about it later. During my years in college, I also won many scholarships or awards from the school many times. When it comes to tuition, I also work part-time and can pay for it myself without depending on my parents. If I graduate from college, I will probably continue to study for a master's degree, but I feel that the more important thing is that my future is still very long ahead, so if I continue with a job that I have no passion for, will it make me comfortable? During my university studies, I also studied some subjects related to coding and I was also interested in it, so I also learned to learn coding on my own. But perhaps studying on your own will not be as good as receiving formal training at the university level. I was also thinking about retaking the university entrance exam after graduating into the information technology field. but with that comes the trade-off of being 4-5 years slower than my peers plus family expectations. I also want to make money quickly to repay my parents. I have heard about studying a second degree or in-service training, but I have also heard reviews about the quality of training not being as good as the regular system. As for studying for a master's degree in another field like IT, I consulted them and they almost all require a university degree before continuing their studies. Now, if you want to apply for IT, you also need expertise and a university degree. I know I'm probably someone who doesn't have a clear plan and roadmap, but I think it's better to be a few years late than a lifetime late, right? I'm very confused between the safe choice of continuing to study for a master's degree and then having the opportunity to go abroad to study for a doctorate and return home to work as a lecturer or going all in with the risky choice of re-taking the university entrance exam into a field that I'm more passionate about? Can anyone please give me advice? I will accept everyone's comments. Thank you!","Nên học tiếp lên Thạc sĩ hay thi lại Đại học ạ? Em chào mọi người ạ. Em là nam sinh năm 2002 ạ. Hiện tại em đang là sinh viên năm cuối ngành Cơ điện tử của Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội ạ. Em là một đứa học tuy không quá xuất sắc nhưng kết quả học tập cũng tạm ổn ạ (27,35 điểm khối A00 năm 2020 và CPA hiện tại khoảng 3.4 - Bằng Giỏi). Kỳ này hiện em đang làm Đồ án tốt nghiệp cử nhân để ra trường và dự kiến tới tháng 7 là tốt nghiệp ạ. Trước đây lúc chọn ngành để thi Đại học thì em cũng nghe tư vấn tuyển sinh của thầy cô và nhà trường thì thấy ngành cơ điện tử cũng khá hay và thú vị với lại hơn nữa HUST còn là một trường kỹ thuật có tiếng nên sau này ra ngoài đi làm sẽ thuận lợi hơn ạ. Khi lên đại học thì 2 năm đầu nói chung cũng học những môn đại cương là chính nên em cũng chăm chỉ học tập để đạt điểm cao chứ cũng chưa có lộ trình rõ ràng lắm ạ. Nhưng đến khi lên năm 3 thì bắt đầu với các môn cơ sở ngành nên em bắt đầu xin vào các Lab nghiên cứu của các thầy cô trong Khoa thì em mới có thể hiểu được thực tế mình sẽ làm gì ở ngành này ạ. Cũng chính lúc đó em nhận ra rằng mình không có đam mê với những công việc như vậy và khá mông lung trong việc sẽ làm gì khi tốt nghiệp ạ. Mặc dù vậy nhưng khi tham gia Lab thì em vẫn chăm chỉ học hỏi kinh nghiệm từ các anh chị và cũng có đạt giải ở cuộc thi nghiên cứu khoa học ở trường vì em nghĩ là cứ cố gắng để cho profile đẹp một chút rồi tính sau ạ. Trong suốt những năm học đại học thì em cũng từng nhiều lần giành học bổng hay nhiều danh hiệu khen thưởng của nhà trường. Vấn đề học phí thì em cũng tự đi làm thêm và có thể tự chi trả mà không cần phụ thuộc vào bố mẹ. Nếu tốt nghiệp Đại học thì có lẽ em sẽ tiếp tục với việc học lên Thạc sĩ nhưng em thấy rằng điều quan trọng hơn là tương lai của mình ở phía trước còn rất dài nên nếu cứ tiếp tục với một công việc mà mình không có đam mê như vậy liệu có khiến mình thoải mái không ạ? Trong quá trình học đại học em cũng có học một số môn liên quan đến code và em cũng thấy hứng thú với nó nên em cũng đã tự tìm hiểu học code. Nhưng có lẽ việc tự học một mình sẽ không bằng việc được đào tạo bài bản ở bậc đại học. Em cũng đã suy nghĩ đến việc sẽ thi lại đại học sau khi tốt nghiệp vào ngành công nghệ thông tin. Nhưng cùng với đó là sự đánh đổi chậm hơn 4-5 năm so với các bạn cùng trang lứa cộng với sự mong đợi của gia đình. Em cũng muốn được mau chóng kiếm tiền để báo đáp cho bố mẹ. Việc học văn bằng 2 hay học tại chức thì em cũng có nghe nói đến nhưng em cũng nghe review về chất lượng đào tạo sẽ không được bằng như hệ chính quy ạ. Còn về việc học lên Thạc sĩ một ngành khác như CNTT thì em có tham khảo họ cũng hầu như đều yêu cầu có bằng đại học rồi mới được học lên tiếp ạ. Bây giờ nếu muốn apply được ngành CNTT thì cũng cần có chuyên môn và bằng đại học nữa ạ. Em biết có lẽ mình là một đứa không có kế hoạch và lộ trình rõ ràng nhưng em nghĩ thà muộn vài năm còn hơn là muộn cả đời có đúng không ạ. Em rất phân vân giữa lựa chọn an toàn là học tiếp lên Thạc sĩ rồi có thể có cơ hội ra nước ngoài học Tiến sĩ và về nước làm giảng viên hoặc tất tay với một lựa chọn mạo hiểm là thi lại đại học vào ngành mà mình có đam mê hơn ạ? Mọi người có thể cho em xin lời khuyên được không ạ. Em sẽ đón nhận mọi ý kiến đóng góp của mọi người ạ. Em xin cảm ơn ạ!","should i continue study a master's degree retake university entrance exam ? hello everyone . i'm a male bear 2002 . currently , i a final year student majoring mechatronics hanoi polytechnic university . although i not a very excellent student , my academic result still okay ( 27 . 35 point block a00 2020 current cpa about 3 . 4 - excellent degree ). term , i currently work my bachelor's degree thesis graduate expect graduate july . previously , when choose a major take university entrance exam , i also listen admission advice from teacher school find mechatronics major quite good interesting . furthermore , hust also a famous technical school , go out work future will more convenient . when i go university , first 2 year mainly about general subject , i also study hard get high score , i didn't have a very clear path . when i reach 3rd year , i start basic subject industry , i start apply research lab teacher department i could understand what i would actually do industry . time i realize i have no passion such job quite confused about what i would do when i graduate . even , when i join lab , i still work hard learn experience from my colleague also win a prize a scientific research competition school because i think i should just try make my profile a little nicer then think about later . during my year college , i also win many scholarship award from school many time . when come tuition , i also work part - time can pay myself without depend my parent . if i graduate from college , i will probably continue study a master's degree , i feel more important thing my future still very long ahead , if i continue a job i have no passion , will make me comfortable ? during my university study , i also study some subject relate cod i also interested , i also learn learn cod my own . perhaps study your own will not good a receive formal training university level . i also think about retake university entrance exam after graduate into information technology field . come trade - off 4 - 5 year slow than my peer plus family expectation . i also want make money quickly repay my parent . i have hear about study a second degree - service training , i have also hear review about quality train not good a regular system . a study a master's degree another field like , i consult them they almost all require a university degree before continue their study . now , if you want apply , you also need expertise a university degree . i know i'm probably someone who doesn't have a clear plan roadmap , i think it's good a few year late than a lifetime late , right ? i'm very confused between safe choice continue study a master's degree then have opportunity go abroad study a doctorate return home work a a lecturer go all risky choice re - take university entrance exam into a field i'm more passionate about ? can anyone please give me advice ? i will accept everyone's comment . thank you !",Depression

I thank you from the bottom of my heart: it has been 2 months since the graduation exam ended, my exam scores and the major I was admitted to are truly a tragedy. I only blame my own subjectivity and carelessness for having to accept such an outcome. I passed the anti-slip major - mechanical engineering at Vietnam Maritime University. From that day until now, I have been tossing and turning every night, before going to sleep. just trying to roam around on many forums just to find prospects in the industry. But the result is nothing more than the harshness of the industry, both hard and sometimes dangerous, causing injuries and even life-threatening. The labor effort, brainpower, and study time are not inferior to hot fields like it, but the salary is twice as bad, three times that. In Vietnam, there is no place to practice martial arts and most of all, I see many people who have gone before, regretting not seeing the ungratefulness of the industry. During my career, I also suffered attacks from my whole family and myself. Every night I closed my eyes I was filled with despair. I had 2 choices:
 1. Try to pursue a major, study as best as you can, then go abroad to work (top heavy industry countries: Japan, Germany) 

2. Retake the exam: considering the circumstances, the current retake with free candidates is like a gamble.

Hello everyone, I was born in 2004, my academic performance is quite good, I took the second prize in provincial physics twice, 2022 high school exam 27.05 points block A01 (plus priority is 27.55), but somehow that year I was quite carefree about choosing a major and choosing a university, I chose IT because I saw it was a trend, at first I intended to study BK in Danang, and also I had no intention of going to a private school, but because I was lazy to research and my family listened to what they were saying, they convinced me to go to FPT, and then I followed without learning much about other schools. After studying for a while, I saw my friends of the same age studying few public schools, they complained about the difficulty of their school's subjects, complained about the peer pressure of their school, but looking back at my school, I saw that the knowledge the school taught was really not as much and not as difficult, the exam method was 100% multiple choice which was not really effective, we only studied for 10 weeks in a 4-month semester, and my friends around me only had a few good students, I really didn't have the motivation to be excited. Duong, I feel that if I graduate here, my chances will actually be extremely narrow compared to my peers. I plan to reserve the exam to retake uit, hcmus or bkdn.

Since childhood, my mother and I have had many disagreements, usually because of different thoughts. For example, when it comes to love, my mother always insists that I have to pass the exam to fall in love. Sometimes she even says it's better not to date for the entire 4 years, and I don't even allow it to text or go out with friends of the opposite sex. I was liking and talking to a friend, and wrote it in my diary, but while I was at school, my mother opened it and read it. Because of that, my mother forced me to go home while I was at school. When I said I'd come back later this afternoon, it led to the above messages. This is not the first time, I have heard such sentences since I was only 3-4 years old, also from my mother. And when asked, my mother always said that it was because she had a mental illness since childhood and was not cared for in the past that's why she was like this. My mother also often wants me to participate and compete in this and that tournament. When she sees her peers receiving scholarships, even though she says she doesn't care, she often repeats why she can't be like them. I'm also very sad and feel tired, but when I explain these things to my mother (I speak very normally), I always receive statements like ""what can you do to complain"" or being told that you're rude. I hope that when I pass university, I will move out to the dormitory, but I'm afraid I won't be allowed and will continue to be scolded. 

Please give me advice what should I do now? Thank you!!","Mqh không tốt với mẹ Em chào mọi người ạ, em sinh năm 2k7, hiện đang trong giai đoạn ôn thi. 

Từ nhỏ thì mqh của em và mẹ có nhiều bất đồng, thường là vì suy nghĩ khác nhau. Ví dụ như về chuyện tình cảm, mẹ em luôn một mực bắt phải đậu ĐH mới được yêu đương, nhiều lúc còn nói tốt hơn thì đừng hẹn hò cho hết 4 năm ĐH luôn, thậm chí là em nhắn tin hay đi chơi với bạn bè khác giới cũng không cho phép. Em có đang thích và nói chuyện một bạn, có ghi vào nhật ký thì trong lúc em đi học mẹ đã mở ra đọc. Vì việc đó mà mẹ bắt em phải về nhà trong lúc đang trên trường, khi em nói chiều về nói chuyện sau thì dẫn đến những dòng tin nhắn trên. Đây không phải lần đầu, em đã nghe những câu như vậy từ khi chỉ mới 3-4 tuổi, cũng chính từ mẹ. Và khi hỏi thì mẹ em luôn nói là vì mẹ có bệnh tâm lý từ bé và ngày xưa không được quan tâm nên mới như vậy. Mẹ em cũng hay muốn em phải tham gia và thi giải này giải nọ, khi nhìn thấy những bạn đồng trang lứa được học bổng thì dù nói là không quan tâm nhưng hay nhắc đi nhắc lại tại sao em không được như ngta. Em cũng rất buồn và cảm thấy mệt mỏi, nhưng khi giải thích với mẹ (em nói rất bình thường ạ) những việc ấy thì luôn nhận được những câu như “Mày làm được gì mà than” hoặc bị nói là hỗn láo. Em mong muốn là khi đậu ĐH rồi sẽ chuyển ra KTX nhưng em sợ không được cho phép và sẽ tiếp tục bị mắng chửi.

1phce0x,1765200508.0,2025-12-08 13:28:28,"I just entered the world and wrote this article to confide a little, when I left dozens of tasks unfinished, I am writing these lines with intense sleepiness that I don't dare to sleep because I don't want to open my eyes and it's a new day.

I'm 22 years old, I just graduated in April this year. I just became an official marketing employee with a salary of 14 million and an additional job outside with a salary of 6 million, total for a month now I will earn 20 million.

I know that earning 20 million/month at this age is not high (compared to now, or some people on the threads) but I personally feel that this 20 million makes me suffocate.

I started working in the crypto/web3 field in my third year of college with a part-time position. After graduating, I was promoted to full-time with a salary of 10 million (remote, no insurance, no contract). I found the job there too boring, just writing content, so I went looking for a new job. The new company offered me 14 million, with contract, full insurance but working full time on site.

During the 2 month probationary period, I really wanted to leave because the environment was toxic and complicated. But my boyfriend said it's something everyone has to go through and advised me to try to keep this job. I told the instructors that I wanted to leave, and they advised me to stay, saying that I did a good job and communicated well. Even though I refused, they always told me to stay. I was also moved, so I chose to stay.

In my department there are 5 people, there is 1 person I never want to talk to and I am really annoyed with the way they talk but they keep trying to talk to me. When you ask for help, you take credit for it, ""I'll do it all by myself"", if you ask for just this or that, you say ""I'm afraid my intelligence won't be able to absorb it"", talking normally puts me in a secretive position, like making people think I'm mean.

I'm also often verbally harassed by staff in other rooms, like asking me if I often go to hotels with my boyfriend, then holding my hand even though I object, then asking me if I'm filming with my boyfriend (I'm sure you can understand what you're filming) or often teasing me to please them or else they'll tell the department head and not give me a probationary pass, and dozens of other things.

I'm extremely exhausted.

6:30 a.m. wake up to cook, 7:30 a.m. shower, get ready, drive to the company at 8 a.m., work at 9 a.m. until 6 p.m., return from 6 p.m. until 7 p.m., eat quickly at 7 p.m., work, then shower at 9 or 10 p.m., use the phone a little, then sleep.

The price of 20 million/month means I can't play.

I like to play badminton. There are a few days when I can take advantage of it. When I get home at 7:00 p.m., I quickly eat and then run across the yard at 7:30 p.m. From 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., to be honest, I don't have the strength to play with all my might anymore. Sometimes when I'm placed in a group of people who don't know how to move, I get very tired, and sometimes I get hit in the head with a racket by those people. so it's not fun at all.

I also want to have time to play games, I bought the mystbloom 2.0 bundle in game v but these days I can only play 1 game.

In the past, I bought materials to make handmade items to make extra money (I like to make things), so I bought a lot of them, but now I just let them go because I don't have time to cut paper, let alone paint, then pour resin and heat it..

I feel really tired, right now.

But I also really need money, because I want to study more. 

Now I just want to cry, I'm so upset.

Thank you for reading these sentences of mine, I wish everyone a happy and happy evening.","Mới bước chân ra đời Em viết bài này để tâm sự xíu, khi mà em bỏ dở hàng tá công việc cần làm, em đang viết những dòng này với cơn buồn ngủ dữ dội mà em không dám ngủ vì không muốn mở mắt ra lại là một ngày mới.

Em 22F, em mới ra trường hồi tháng 4 năm nay. Em vừa lên làm nhân viên marketing chính thức với mức lương 14 triệu và làm thêm ở ngoài với mức lương 6 triệu, tổng 1 tháng hiện tại em sẽ kiếm được 20 triệu.

Em biết kiếm được 20 triệu/tháng ở tuổi này không phải gọi là cao (so với bây giờ, hoặc mấy bạn trên threads) nhưng cá nhân em tự cảm thấy, 20 triệu này khiến em nghẹt thở.

Em bắt đầu làm trong mảng crypto/web3 từ năm 3 đại học với vị trí part time, ra trường em được lên full-time với mức lương 10 triệu (remote, không bảo hiểm, hợp đồng), em thấy công việc ở đó quá chán, chỉ quanh quẩn ở việc viết content nên em có đi tìm việc mới. Công ty mới offer em 14tr, có hợp đồng, bảo hiểm đầy đủ nhưng làm full time on site.

Trong 2 tháng thử việc em rất muốn out vì môi trường toxic và phức tạp. Nhưng bạn trai em nói đó là điều ai cũng phải trải qua và khuyên em hãy cố gắng giữ công việc này. Em đã nói với người hướng dẫn là em muốn out, và họ khuyên em ở lại, nói là em làm việc tốt, giao tiếp rất ổn, dù em có từ chối nhưng họ vẫn luôn bảo em ở lại, em cũng có động lòng, nên em chọn ở lại.

Trong phòng ban em có 5 người, có 1 người em không bao giờ muốn nói chuyện và em thật sự rất khó chịu với cách nói chuyện của họ nhưng họ lại cứ tìm cách nói chuyện với em. Nhờ vả em  thì cướp công ""cái đó 1 mình t làm hết"", nhờ chỉ cái này cái kia thì nói ""sợ trí tuệ của em không tiếp thu nổi"", nói chuyện bình thường thì đưa em vào thế bí, kiểu làm mọi người nghĩ em xấu tính ấy.

Em cũng hay bị nhân viên phòng khác quấy rối bằng lời nói, kiểu hỏi em có hay đi khách sạn với bạn trai không, rồi nắm tay em dù em chống đối, rồi hỏi em có quay phim với bạn trai không (quay gì chắc mn cũng hiểu) hoặc thường trêu em phải làm hài lòng họ nếu không họ sẽ mách trưởng phòng và không cho em pass thử việc và hàng tá chuyện khác.

Em kiệt sức vô cùng.

6h30 sáng dậy nấu cơm, 7h30 tắm rửa, sửa soạn, 8h chạy xe đến công ty, 9h làm đến 18h, 18h về tới 19h, 19h ăn vội, làm việc rồi 21 hoặc 22h tắm, bấm điện thoại xíu rồi ngủ.

Cái giá của 20 triệu/tháng là em không được chơi.

Em thích chơi cầu lông, có vài hôm em tranh thủ được thì 19h về em ăn vội rồi 19h30 chạy qua sân. 20h đánh đến 22h, nói thật thì em cũng không còn sức để đánh hết mình nữa, có khi bị xếp vô mấy người lệch trình không biết di chuyển em cũng mệt lắm, cũng có khi em bị mấy người đó vả vợt vào đầu nữa. Nên cũng chẳng vui vẻ gì cả.

Em cũng muốn có thời gian để chơi game, em mua cả bundle mystbloom 2.0 ở game V nhưng mấy hôm nay em chỉ chơi được 1 trận.

Trước đây em mua nguyên liệu về để làm handmade kiếm thêm (em thích làm) nên em mua rất nhiều, giờ lại bỏ xó vì không có thời gian để cắt giấy nói gì là tô vẽ rồi đổ resin hơ đèn..

Em thật sự thấy rất mệt, hiện tại là vậy.

Nhưng em cũng rất cần tiền, vì em muốn học thêm nữa. 

Giờ em chỉ muốn khóc thôi, em bí bách quá đi.

Cảm ơn anh chị em đã đọc mấy câu này của em, chúc mọi người buổi tối vui vẻ và hạnh phúc.","i just enter world write article confide a little , when i leave dozen task unfinished , i write these line intense sleepiness i don't dare sleep because i don't want open my eye it's a new day . i'm 22 year old , i just graduate april year . i just become an official marketing employee a salary 14 million an additional job outside a salary 6 million , total a month now i will earn 20 million . i know earn 20 million / month age not high ( compare now , some people thread ) i personally feel 20 million make me suffocate . i start work crypto / web3 field my third year college a part - time position . after graduate , i promote full - time a salary 10 million ( remote , no insurance , no contract ). i find job there too boring , just write content , i go look a new job . new company offer me 14 million , contract , full insurance work full time site . during 2 month probationary period , i really want leave because environment toxic complicate . my boyfriend say it's something everyone have go through advise me try keep job . i tell instructor i want leave , they advise me stay , say i do a good job communicate well . even though i refuse , they always tell me stay . i also move , i choose stay . my department there 5 people , there 1 person i never want talk i really annoy way they talk they keep try talk me . when you ask help , you take credit , "" i'll do all myself "", if you ask just , you say "" i'm afraid my intelligence won't able absorb "", talk normally put me a secretive position , like make people think i'm mean . i'm also often verbally harass staff other room , like ask me if i often go hotel my boyfriend , then hold my hand even though i object , then ask me if i'm filming my boyfriend ( i'm sure you can understand what you're film ) often tease me please them else they'll tell department head not give me a probationary pas , dozen other thing . i'm extremely exhaust . 6 : 30 a . m . wake up cook , 7 : 30 a . m . shower , get ready , drive company 8 a . m ., work 9 a . m . until 6 p . m ., return from 6 p . m . until 7 p . m ., eat quickly 7 p . m ., work , then shower 9 10 p . m ., use phone a little , then sleep . price 20 million / month mean i can't play . i like play badminton . there a few day when i can take advantage . when i get home 7 : 00 p . m ., i quickly eat then run across yard 7 : 30 p . m . from 8 : 00 p . m . 10 : 00 p . m ., honest , i don't have strength play all my might anymore . sometimes when i'm place a group people who don't know how move , i get very tired , sometimes i get hit head a racket those people . it's not fun all . i also want have time play game , i buy mystbloom 2 . 0 bundle game v these day i can only play 1 game . past , i buy material make handmade item make extra money ( i like make thing ), i buy a lot them , now i just let them go because i don't have time cut paper , let alone paint , then pour resin heat .. i feel really tire , right now . i also really need money , because i want study more . now i just want cry , i'm upset . thank you read these sentence mine , i wish everyone a happy happy evening .",Depression

I'm 20f, as you can see in the title, I still have 8k to continue living. To briefly describe my life, there have been many turning points such as: my parents divorced, my friends stopped going out, I dropped out of school to work, and then I decided to go to college and retake the course. 

I am currently an English teacher at an English center in my hometown, my salary is enough to live for myself and support my mother. After 1 year, I dropped out of school and went to work because my previous financial situation was not enough to support me. I decided that I needed a university degree to be able to find a more secure job and have a better salary. So I registered myself at a university in my hometown and started retaking the course from scratch. but things are not that easy. Because of sick leave and the family's debt litigation problem getting worse, I gradually didn't have enough to cover my own tuition. If you ask why I don't borrow money from my mother, the answer is very difficult. If you ask again why I didn't save money from the moment I started working, the answer is: I took that money to help my mother and family. My mother and I have been buried in debt for a long time, and even the occasional meat dishes I feel are a luxury.

Many times I broke out and cried silently because I didn't know who to tell, but then I wiped my tears away and consoled myself to try harder for my mother and for myself. My biggest problem right now is tuition, where should I earn and borrow enough for 13 million with 8k in my current account? I can't think about how I will eat and drink after paying all the tuition, I can only think about how I will take care of the tuition myself, I cannot give up what I have determined to do. 

I've also been wondering if there's a way to rotate it, but I haven't been able to find it yet. I also tried to earn extra income from tarot reading, but unfortunately because I lost my Facebook account, it was very difficult to find a regular customer base (I couldn't even set up a Facebook account because the more I set it up, the more I lost it for no reason, it was very confusing). I hope through this article, someone can help me find a solution to my hopeless tuition problem. thanks in advance!

Tôi là 20F, đúng như các bạn thấy trên tiêu đề thì tôi vẫn còn được 8k để có thể tiếp tục sống. Cuộc đời tôi để có thể kể sơ qua thì có rất nhiều ngã rẽ như: bố mẹ li dị, bạn bè nghỉ chơi, bỏ học để đi làm, rồi lại quyết định đi học đại học lại. 

Hiện tôi đang là giáo viên tiếng anh của một trung tâm Tiếng Anh tại quê nhà, lương cũng đủ để sống cho bản thân và hỗ trợ cho mẹ. Sau 1 năm tôi bỏ học và đi làm vì kinh tế lúc trước không đủ để gánh vác, tôi đã quyết định mình cần có cái bằng đại học để có thể tìm kiếm công việc yên tâm hơn và mức lương sẽ khá hơn. Vì vậy tôi đã tự đăng kí 1 trường đại học ở quê nhà và bắt đầu học lại từ đầu. Nhưng mọi chuyện lại không dễ như vậy. Vì nghỉ ốm và vấn đề kiện tụng nợ nần của gia đình càng nặng hơn, tôi dần không đủ để có thể trang trải cho tiền học của bản thân mình. Nếu bạn hỏi sao tôi không tự vay mẹ, câu trả lời là rất khó. Nếu bạn lại hỏi tiếp sao tôi không tự tích góp ngay từ lúc bắt đầu đi làm, thì câu trả lời là: tôi đã lấy số tiền đó để phụ giúp mẹ và gia đình. Bản thân tôi và mẹ tôi đã vùi đầu vào nợ nần từ lâu, thậm chí nhưng bữa cơm đôi khi xuất hiện các món thịt tôi cũng cảm thấy xa xỉ.

Nhiều lúc tôi cũng đã breakout, ngồi khóc thầm lặng vì không biết kể với ai nhưng sau đó tôi lại lau nước mắt đi và tự an ủi bản thân mình phải cố gắng vì mẹ và vì chính bản thân mình. Vấn đề lớn nhất của tôi bây giờ đó chính là học phí, tôi phải kiếm và vay mượn ở đâu cho đủ 13tr với 8k trong tài khoản hiện tại? Tôi không nghĩ đến được mình sẽ ăn uống như nào sau khi đắp hết vào tiền học, tôi chỉ có thể nghĩ được tôi sẽ tự mình lo liệu học phí như nào , mình không thể bỏ cuộc việc mình đã quyết tâm làm như vậy được. 

Tôi cũng đã tự ngồi ngẫm xem liệu còn cách nào để có thể xoay không nhưng vẫn chưa thể tìm ra được. Tôi cũng đã thử kiếm them thu nhập từ kênh việc xem Tarot, chỉ tiếc là vì đã mất fb nên tìm lại lượng khách quen rất khó (tôi thậm chí không thể lập được fb vì càng lập tôi lại càng mất không vì lí do gì, rất củ chuối). Tôi mong qua bài viết này, ai đó có thể giúp tôi tìm ra hướng giải quyết với vấn đề học phí mà tôi đang bế tắc. Thanks in advance!

In previous years, when I called for nvqs, I used to get papers from the school but they would only accept 4 years. Whether they have completed 4 years of graduation or not, they will still need to apply for results. The main problem here is that I lost both parents a long time ago, have no siblings and have been living independently for more than a decade now. no wife or children yet. If I leave now, I will put aside the career I have been trying for for so many years. The house will be abandoned for 2 years, the incense altar will not be cared for by parents. When I first went to the ward council to submit my application and explain my situation, the army recruiter also told me that if my situation was so difficult, who would let me go? Then it was he who gave me the 1st round of medical examination and just now the 2nd round of medical examination. My general health is quite good. Both eyes are 10/10. I rarely get examined for internal diseases, so I'm not sure if there's anything wrong. Now there are a few days left until the second medical examination and I really don't know what to do. I know that going will be good for me, but really, with my current condition, I can't go because if I go, everything will be lost. Not to mention that I'm having some property division problems with my aunts and uncles about the house I'm living in (which belongs to my grandparents, not my parents'). Sometimes when I leave for 2 years, I still don't have a house to live in. When I go for the second round of medical examination, can I bow or kneel and beg someone at the council for leniency?","Đi NVQS coi như mất hết Chẳng là mình sn 2k, sinh ra và lớn lên ở một quận trung tâm HN, có đi học đại học nhưng do một vài lý do mà mình qđinh đi làm luôn chứ không ra trường. Các năm trc gọi NVQS thì mình đều lấy giấy của trường là xong nhưng họ sẽ chỉ chấp nhận 4 năm. Hết 4 năm ra trường hay chưa thì họ cx kqt nữa. Vấn đề chính ở đây là mình đã mồ côi cả cha lẫn mẹ từ lâu, ko có anh chị em gì và đã sinh sống tự lập một mình đc hơn chục năm nay rồi. Cũng chưa vợ con gì. Giờ mà đi thì sẽ gác lại sự nghiệp bao năm nay mình cố gắng. Nhà cửa sẽ bỏ hoang trong 2 năm trời, bàn thờ hương khói cha mẹ sẽ không ai chăm sóc. Khi lên ban CHQS phường lần đầu để nộp đơn và trình bày hoàn cảnh thì ông tuyển quân cũng đã bảo mình rằng trường hợp hoàn cảnh như m khó khăn thế thì ai cho m đi. Rồi cũng chính ông ấy đưa cho mình giấy khám skhoe đợt 1 và vừa rồi là giấy khám đợt 2. Mình thì sức khỏe mặt bằng chung khá tốt. Cả 2 mắt thì đều 10/10. Các bệnh nội cơ thể thì mình ít khám skhoe nên cx không rõ là có bị làm sao ko. Giờ còn mấy hôm nữa là đến ngày khám sk đợt 2 rồi mà thực sự thì không biết phải làm gì. Biết là đi thì sẽ tốt cho mình nhưng thực sự với tình trạng của mình bây giờ thì không thể đi được vì nếu đi thì sẽ coi như là mất hết. Đó là còn chưa nói đến việc mình đang gặp một vài vấn đề phân chia tài sản với cô chú bác của mình về ngôi nhà mình đang ở (là nhà của ông bà chứ ko phải của bố mẹ mình để lại). Có khi đi 2 năm về còn ko có nhà để ở.

I'm an auditing student who just graduated about half a year late compared to my peers. During my time in school, because I was quite dependent on my family's financial means, I hardly paid attention to my studies. My scores were just enough to pass the subject, so my knowledge and expertise were non-existent.

As a man, I don't want to rely on my family anymore, so in the past year, I've tried to improve my scores and knowledge, but it really hasn't worked because I'm so lacking in knowledge. Currently, I'm just trying to improve my English for higher education and my health because last year I also had some health problems.
Next year, my family is planning to pursue higher education in MBA. At the same time, I want to find a job to gain experience and earn extra income, but I'm stuck. Actually, I myself don't know what to do after finishing my master's degree.

At this time, my friends also have income and jobs, but I'm still struggling with no direction, so I'm quite pressured. Because of these thoughts, I only rely on learning English and practicing to make myself feel valuable. But the training didn't work, and I was constantly injured, so it was quite taxing on me mentally, leading to sleep disorders, continuous insomnia for the past few months, and now I still have 1 or 2 meals every once in a while.
I hope you guys can share and give me some advice. Thank you very much everyone.","Sinh viên vừa ra trường không có định hướng Em chào các bác ạ, em muốn chia sẻ câu chuyện của bản thân một chút ạ. Em là sinh viên ngành Kiểm toán vừa mới tốt nghiệp muộn tầm nửa năm so với lứa em. Trong thời gian đi học do khá ỉ lại vào gia đình có chút điều kiện nên em hầu như không để tâm vào việc học, điểm số chỉ vừa đủ để qua môn nên kiến thức và chuyên môn của em đều không có.

Là đàn ông con trai em cũng không muốn dựa vào gia đình mãi nữa nên trong 1 năm đổ lại đây em cũng có gắng cải thiện điểm số và kiến thức nhưng thực sự là không ăn thua vì bản thân đã bị rỗng kiến thức quá. Hiện tại thì em chỉ đang cố gắng cải thiện tiếng anh để học lên cao và sức khoẻ thôi vì năm vừa rồi em cũng có 1 số vấn đề về sức khoẻ.
Trong năm tới em được gia đình định hướng là sẽ học lên cao ngành MBA, song song với đấy thì em muốn kiếm 1 công việc gì đấy làm để có kinh nghiệm với thêm thu nhập mà bí quá. Thực sự bản thân em cũng không rõ học xong thạc sĩ xong để làm gì nữa ạ.

Tầm này bạn bè em cũng có thu nhập, công việc hết rồi mà bản thân vẫn loay hoay chưa có định hướng nên khá áp lực, cũng vì những suy nghĩ này nên em chỉ có dựa vào việc học tiếng anh và tập luyện để bản thân cảm thấy có giá trị. Nhưng việc tập luyện không có kết quả, lại gặp chấn thương liên tục nên khá nặng nề về tinh thần với bản thân em dẫn đến bị rối loạn giấc ngủ, mất ngủ liên tục vài tháng gần đây giờ lâu lâu vẫn bị 1 2 bữa.

1ksnlnt,1747910768.0,2025-05-22 10:46:08,"Some ways to reduce peer pressure or overcome the difficult period of the last year of college about to graduate. Hello guys. I'm 22 years old and studying English. Since Tet, I've been having a hard time submitting my CV to many fields. In addition, many incidents have happened, so I've spent most of my savings. I have a girlfriend who hasn't worked for 3 years and just stays at the dormitory. Suddenly, at the end of last year, she was accepted as an intern for a fairly large cosmetics company with a salary of 7 million a month. Since then, progress has been good and has been officially received. This July, I will get 1x salary. Recently, I heard that my boss is about to give me an experience in Shanghai and now I have received another short-term Chinese translation job from a short-term acquaintance. It must be called suddenly a lot of strange luck. 

I myself am the same age this year. But I'm still stuck in 3 subjects and can't get out at the end of the year. Since Tet until now, most of my CVs are silent or rejected, I have to continue to work at a shopping center with a low salary of 3-4 million a month, just enough to make ends meet😕. Sometimes when I see you like that, I'm very happy, but behind that is an extremely large peer pressure. Even though we talked and you encouraged me all the way and helped me find a job, even a slot at the company yesterday (rejected because this final semester involved all 3 afternoons). So now I feel like I'm quite a loser, to put it bluntly. 

Even though I received a lot of comfort from family members, sometimes it reappears so I feel very sad. The economic situation is difficult, so applying for an internship is more difficult than ever, plus peer pressure, it's truly a difficult time. Many times I talk to myself to get better, but it's only a short period of time, partly because of pressure and partly because of the fear of losing her 🫣(you are a person from a not-rich family background but are extremely understanding and sympathetic, and have never asked me for much) 

If there are any seniors who have gone through the same period, I hope you can give me some useful advice in the current situation! I really appreciate it when people can share with me.","1 số cách giảm peer pressure hoặc khắc phục trong giai đoạn khó khăn năm cuối đại học sắp ra trường. Chào các bác. Em năm nay 22 tuổi học Ngôn ngữ Anh, từ tết đến giờ hơi chật vật rải nộp cv nhiều lĩnh vực thêm nữa là có nhiều biến cố xảy ra nên tiêu gần hết tiền tiết kiệm. Em có 1 cô người yêu, cả 3 năm không đi làm chỉ ở ktx bất ngờ cuối năm ngoái được nhận intern cho 1 công ty mỹ phẩm khá lớn lương 7tr 1 tháng. Từ đó đến nay thì tiến độ tốt và đã được nhận chính thức. Tháng 7 này sẽ lên với đầu lương 1X, vừa rồi thì nghe tin sắp được sếp cho đi trải nghiệm tại thượng hải và nay lại nhận thêm 1 job dịch tiếng trung của người quen ngắn hạn. Phải gọi là đột nhiên nhiều sự may mắn đến kì lạ. 

Bản thân em năm nay cũng bằng tuổi. Nhưng vẫn còn lẹt đẹt 3 môn nữa cuối năm mới lết ra được. Rải cv từ tết đến giờ thì hầu hết là silent hoặc bị reject , phải tiếp tục đèo đọt ở 1 tttm với mức lương lèo bèo 3 4tr 1 tháng đủ sống qua ngày😕, nhiều lúc e thấy bạn vậy thì cũng mừng lắm, nhưng đằng sau đó là 1 cái peer pressure cực kì lớn. Dù tụi em cũng đã có nói chuyện và bạn cũng động viên em hết mình và giúp đỡ kiếm việc dùm cho thậm chí là 1 slot ở cty hôm bữa( bị reject vì kỳ cuối này dính cả 3 buổi chiều ). Nên bữa giờ em cũng cảm thấy mình khá là loser nói thẳng ra là vậy. 

Mặc dù cũng nhận được nhiều lời an ủi từ người nhà nhưng đôi lúc thì nó lại xuất hiện nên thấy buồn lắm các bác. Tình hình kinh tế khó khăn nên việc xin intern khó hơn bao giờ hết thêm peer pressure thì đúng là giai đoạn khó khăn thật. Nhiều lúc em cũng tự nói với lòng mình cho khá hơn nhưng cũng chỉ là 1 khoảng ngắn, 1 phần là áp lực 1 phần là cũng sợ mất đi bạn ấy 🫣( bạn là 1 người xuất thân gia cảnh k phải là giàu nhưng cực kì hiểu chuyện và biết cảm thông, chưa từng đòi hỏi em gì nhiều ) 

Nếu có các đàn anh đàn chị nào cũng đã từng trải qua giai đoạn như vậy thì mong các cô chú anh chị có thể cho em 1 lời khuyên hữu ích trong hoàn cảnh bây giờ! Em rất cảm kích khi mọi người có thể chia sẻ cho em.","some way reduce peer pressure overcome difficult period last year college about graduate . hello guy . i'm 22 year old study english . since tet , i've have a hard time submit my cv many field . addition , many incident have happen , i've spent most my saving . i have a girlfriend who hasn't work 3 year just stay dormitory . suddenly , end last year , she accept a an intern a fairly large cosmetic company a salary 7 million a month . since then , progress have good have officially receive . july , i will get 1x salary . recently , i hear my bos about give me an experience shanghai now i have receive another short - term chinese translation job from a short - term acquaintance . must call suddenly a lot strange luck . i myself same age year . i'm still stick 3 subject can't get out end year . since tet until now , most my cv silent reject , i have continue work a shopping center a low salary 3 - 4 million a month , just enough make ends meet . sometimes when i see you like , i'm very happy , behind an extremely large peer pressure . even though we talk you encourage me all way help me find a job , even a slot company yesterday ( reject because final semester involve all 3 afternoon ). now i feel like i'm quite a loser , put bluntly . even though i receive a lot comfort from family member , sometimes reappear i feel very sad . economic situation difficult , apply an internship more difficult than ever , plus peer pressure , it's truly a difficult time . many time i talk myself get well , it's only a short period time , partly because pressure partly because fear lose her ( you a person from a not - rich family background extremely understanding sympathetic , have never ask me much ) if there any senior who have go through same period , i hope you can give me some useful advice current situation ! i really appreciate when people can share me .",Depression

Actually, I liked him a long time ago. He studies for the team, his classroom is on the same floor as me. That's why he often passes by her class, after many times I've fallen in love with him... he's small, has white skin, wears glasses and looks very scholarly, and studies well (high score on HSGQG exam), then he really runs out of dipping sauce.

After a while, I unrushed the photo with a very stupid reason (I'm not ready yet so I'll still make mistakes... but now knowing that mistake is also a step forward...). Even though I showed my simp face before :( intending to get to know each other (yes, I like liking a guy even though he and I don't know each other ;-;) so I dropped the hint first to see if I smiled at him and... he smiled back. Intuitively, I said he knew I liked him, and it probably wouldn't be too annoying. And yes, when I stopped liking him, it seemed like he knew too.

and then again... recently, I was able to correct that one error in thinking. So now looking back, it's clear that I just... let go of a wonderful person (up to now) for no reason at all. And it's almost the moment we're apart (one more week), so to be honest, the feeling of regret and attachment is controlling and urging me... I think I'll regret it if I let him out of my reach... so, I want to ask everyone to give me a plan to get to know/flirt/... with him.

As for me: my appearance is okay, I've been complimented by a few friends of the same gender and the opposite gender, I'm also pretty good at studying: I'm currently studying in a specialized school and also ranked in the top 10, and I also know how to think about improving myself (appearance, qualifications,...). In terms of personality, I'm quite honest, cheerful, enthusiastic and also have a bit of a sense of humor (once I get used to it, I'll show it when I'm no longer shy), or... naughty...

Bẵng đi 1 thời gian thì em uncrush ảnh với 1 lý do rất củ chuối (hic em chưa chín nên sẽ còn mắc lỗi dài dài... nhưng hiện tại biết cái sai đó cũng là 1 bước tiến rồi ạ...).

Và sau đó nữa thì... gần đây ạ, em có sửa được 1 lỗi tư tưởng đó. Nên giờ nhìn lại thì rõ ràng mình vừa... thả đi một người tuyệt vời (cho đến thời điểm hiện tại) không vì lý do gì cả.

Physical age: 29

Gender of biological father and mother: female

Place to eat and sleep until now: Ho Chi Minh City 

Situation: single and not thinking about the future

Number of years earning a living: 8 years

When I was little, my mother told me I was like an autistic child, walking slowly, eating slowly, speaking slowly and being very quiet 🥲. At school age, I studied leisurely, neither good nor bad, only interested in two subjects: literature and English. I had quite a hard time going through school even though I wasn't disruptive at all (had no friends and was bullied by the teacher), the only thing I remember at that time was that I was quite persistent (like never mind, just do your best no matter what).

until I entered university, I failed the major I chose and studied my 2nd choice, a major I never thought I would study - computer science 🥲 (because I'm bad at math, information, and logic). And still with the spirit of letting it go, just don't fail the exam, I dragged myself through 4 years of university with a score no less than 6.0 🙉

When I started working, it seemed like I was getting a little better, the first company was outsourcing vn, and the characteristic of outsourcing is ot, the first 3 years I worked 10-12 hours a day with a salary enough for medicine 🤢 (there were also many illnesses due to overwork). Fortunately, my parents still loved me and provided me with the basic needs at that time. My love for languages ​​was still dancing cha cha in my head, so I decided to find a more international environment. After 999 incidents of changing companies, more specifically 3 times (mostly due to eviction, layoff, conflict with lead,...) I have now landed at a global product company with a net salary of more than 50 with better benefits than ever (to be honest, I never thought about it) so what is the summary? I still live with my family (maybe in the future I will rent because my parents' house is a bit small and crowded 🌃), the good thing is that I have enough money to support my family and take care of myself. Savings are temporary, no gold, no land or house, few friends (I'm too lazy to talk so I don't ask 🥲), and also a bit more free and can buy what I like (I like to draw so buying painting tools is also expensive)

Time passed so quickly that I turned 30, I felt that I was too normal, even mediocre, I had no direction for myself and nothing profound. Maybe there are people luckier than me, maybe I'm luckier than some people, just don't compare, let it go 🥲

Thanks for reading even though it makes no sense!!!!","Chán chán nên viết về một cuộc sống bình thường Nếu bạn đọc được post này , cứ tưởng tượng mình đang nói với giọng ngang phè phè, không than phiền không bức xúc gì cả 🙂

Tuổi vật lý: 29

Giới tính cha sinh mẹ đẻ : female

Nơi ăn ngủ từ trước tới nay: TPHCM 

Hoàn cảnh : single và không nghĩ gì tới tương lai

Số năm mưu sinh: 8 năm

Hồi bé mẹ mình kể mình giống trẻ tự kỉ dị, đi chậm , ăn chậm , biết nói chậm và rất im lặng 🥲. Vào độ tuổi đi học mình học cũng nhàn nhàn , không giỏi không dở , chỉ thích 2 môn là Văn và Anh . Mình trải qua thời đi học khá chật vật cho dù mình không quậy phá gì cả (không có bạn và bị giáo viên đì ) , thứ duy nhất mình nhớ lúc đó là mình khá kiên trì (kiểu như kệ hết, sao cũng được cứ làm hết sức mình).

Lèo bèo tới năm lên đại học, mình rớt ngành mình chọn và học nguyện vọng 2 , 1 ngành mình chưa từng nghĩ tới mình sẽ học - CNTT 🥲 (tại mình dốt toán , dốt tin , dốt lý ). Và vẫn với tinh thần kệ nó đại đại đi, ko rớt môn là được , minh lê lết qua 4 năm đại học với số điểm cũng lê lết ko kém 6.0 🙉

Tới lúc đi làm có vẻ như mình được độ 1 chút, cty đầu là outsource VN , mà đặc trưng của outsource là OT , 3 năm đầu mình đi làm 10-12 tiếng 1 ngày với mức lương đủ cho thuốc men 🤢 (bệnh cũng nhiều do làm việc quá sức ). Cũng hên là cha má vẫn thương , cung cấp cho mình những yêu cầu cơ bản thời điểm đó. Niềm yêu thích ngôn ngữ của mình vẫn nhảy cha cha cha trong đầu mình , nên mình quyết định tìm môi trường quốc tế hơn. Sau 999 kiếp nạn nhảy công ty mà chi tiết hơn là 3 lần (đa phần do bị đuổi , layoff, xung đột với lead,…) hiện tại mình đã cập bến tại 1 cty product global với mức hơn net hơn 50 với những đãi ngộ ổn hơn bao giờ (nói thiệt là mình chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến) Vậy tóm lại là sao ? Mình vẫn sống cùng gia đình (có thể sau này mình sẽ ở thuê vì nhà ba mẹ mình hơi nhỏ và đông người 🌃 ) ,được cái là mình đã có dư để hỗ trợ gia đình và tự chăm lo bản thân. Tiết kiệm cũng tạm tạm , không có vàng, không có đất có nhà gì luôn, bạn bè cũng ít (lười nói quá mà nên không đòi hỏi 🥲), và cũng tự do tự tại hơn tẹo và có thể mua những thứ mình thích (thích vẽ nên mua họa cụ cũng tốn)

Thời gian qua lẹ quá chớp mắt mình đã u30, mình thấy mình quá bình thường , thậm chí là tầm thường, mình không có định hướng gì cho bản thân và cũng không có gì sâu sắc . Có thể có những người may mắn hơn mình , có thể mình may mắn hơn một vài người , chỉ cần mình đừng so sánh là được , kệ đi đại đại đi 🥲

1k1h3pm,1744907402.0,2025-04-17 16:30:02,"My sister threatens my parents to ask for 44, what should I do? I'm the eldest sister, went to school far away, middle-class family, educated parents but have a younger brother who is crazy. I consider myself good, thoughtful, and loving to my parents, so when my family falls into chaos like this, I'm really upset and tired. Children nowadays have a lot of contact with the internet, so they already know about sensitive topics, 44, ... my younger brother saw his middle school classmates doing the same thing and complaining about their fate because they didn't get this or that thing as they wanted. I whispered and warned him right away to let him know it was a wrong action. Unexpectedly, after he entered high school, he would use those same methods to threaten his parents if he did not do what he wanted.

For example: being lazy to study, having bad grades, it's normal to be afraid of being scolded by your parents or something, but my parents don't pressure me for my performance, I just need my child to be good. At the age of 16, today's children want freedom, privacy, etc. If their parents even talk to them a little about their studies, it will start a stuffy, tiring drama that includes the following sets: self [h@.rm](mailto:h@.rm) in obvious places, looking mysterious, metaphors and metaphors about going to the bridge to the river bla bla =). he knows his parents are afraid of him, like all other parents in the world. The area we live in has a big river, so over the years, the cases of students going to the bridge to commit suicide are no longer such a shock, and everyone in the small district town will know the information. My parents took him to a psychologist and all, but I know this is not his illness, because he only threatens my parents every time he is naughty or disobedient. He knows his parents are afraid, so he plays this card game very skillfully. He never does housework, games, or video games. If he calls and doesn't want to listen, then just ignore it. Whatever he wants, he has to pamper him. Confiscate your phone? Are not! He will stick out in many ways to express his right to use, possess and dispose of the phone, even when his father threatens to ""smash the phone"" - Dad, break it, or, let me break it too, and the chickens fly away and the dogs bark...

Is human endurance introduced? So after talking too much, not being able to speak lightly or being heavy, not being able to hold back, today my dad wanted to collect his phone, a set of filming with skilled actors as planned was completed, rachh-tay, metaphorical school afternoon with friends, asked his friend to take him to the bridge to bungee jump, the teacher secretly called his mother. So the poor mother gave up all her work and stood at the school gate waiting for her children. and my mom texted me

Many times I admit that I'm selfish and don't want to go home because that fragile atmosphere of peace doesn't know when it will explode. Going to school far away, there were times when I selfishly thought that going far away would make it easier to be out of sight, so many times I didn't want to go home, but there was always an unknown cloud wandering around and flying above my head. Whenever my mother texted or called, I felt scared. I'm a genuine overthinker, I'm also sensitive so I often think a lot. I know that the people suffering the most are my parents and I love them very much. Every day I have to be patient and endure, otherwise I would probably go crazy. Sometimes I think about how to end the movie, but torturing each other like this over long days and months, mentally torturing each other like that is really too much... he doesn't have the right to consider himself the best, he doesn't have the privilege to sit on his parents' heads. But because of who I am, I know that all parents love their children. If the movie ends, what will happen to my parents? I'm scared just thinking about it... so I quit.

I also have my own things to worry about at school. I'm also very guilty when I pay my parents every month and they give me money for school but I don't get high scores or reach my goals. There's not a single moment that I don't feel guilty and wonder what I did wrong to make my parents suffer like this. I'm stressed about myself, worried about the near future about how to pass a math-related subject at university that I can't learn, and also what I'll do in the future... but I just keep it in my heart, it's so heavy that I don't dare tell anyone. I read my mother's message and felt helpless. I was so tired. I loved my parents even more and blamed myself even more. But I can't tell my mother ""don't vent because you're already very stressed"", because besides me, who else can she tell?

I don't know how to handle this, I'm very upset, but I can only control the things within my control. extremely helpless...","Em gái dọa bố mẹ đòi 44, phải làm sao? Mình là chị cả, đi học xa, gia đình tầm trung, bố mẹ trí thức nhưng có đứa em trời đánh. Mình tự nhận bản thân ngoan, biết suy nghĩ và thương bố mẹ, vậy nên khi gia đình mình rơi vào hỗn loạn như thế này, mình thực sự rất khó chịu và mệt mỏi. Bọn trẻ bây giờ tiếp xúc nhiều với internet nên đã biết về những chủ đề kiểu nhạy cảm, 44, ... Em mình từ hồi nhìn thấy các bạn lớp cấp 2 của nó làm như vậy rồi than trách số phận vì không được thứ này thứ kia như ý, mình đã thủ thỉ căn dặn ngay để nó biết đó là hành động sai. Không ngờ sau khi nó lên cấp 3 thì nó lại dùng chính những cách đó để đe dọa bố mẹ mình nếu không làm theo ý nó.

Ví dụ: lười học, điểm kém, lẽ thường tình sẽ sợ bố mẹ mắng hay gì đó, nhưng bố mẹ mình không áp lực thành tích, chỉ cần con ngoan là được. 16t đầu trẻ con thời nay đòi freedom, privacy các thứ nữa,... Nếu bố mẹ có hơi nói nó một chút về vụ học hành của nó là bắt đầu 1 vở kịch ngột ngạt, mệt mỏi bao gồm các set sau: self [h@.rm](mailto:h@.rm) ở mấy chỗ dễ thấy, tỏ vẻ bí hiểm, ẩn dụ hoán dụ về việc ra cầu ra sông bla bla =). Nó biết bố mẹ sợ nó, giống như tất cả bố mẹ khác trên đời. khu mình ở có sông lớn nên nhiều năm mấy vụ học sinh lên cầu quyên sinh không còn là cái gì đó quá là sốc nữa, và cái phố huyện nhỏ thù ai cũng sẽ biết được thông tin. Bố mẹ mình đưa nó đi khám tâm lý các thứ, nhưng mình biết đây không phải bệnh của nó, vì nó chỉ đe nạt bố mẹ mình mỗi khi mà nó hư, nói không nghe lời, Nó biết bố mẹ sợ nên nó chơi bài này rất thuần thục, không bao giờ làm việc nhà, chơi game, chơi điện tử, nói gọi mà không muốn nghe thì cứ lơ đi, muốn gì thì phải chiều nó cho bằng được. Tịch thu điện thoại ư? không! nó sẽ lỳ ra theo nhiều cách để thể hiện quyền sử dụng, quyền chiếm hữu và quyền định đoạt của nó cho cái điện thoại, thậm chí khi bố mình dọa ""đập đt"" - bố đập đi, hay là, thế để con đập luôn, và nhà mình gà bay chó sủa...

Sức chịu đựng con ng có giới thiệu chứ? vậy là sau khi nói quá nhiều, nói nhẹ nói nặng ko được, không thẻ dồn nén, hôm nay bố muốn thu điện thoại nó, một set quay diễn viên lành nghề như dự tính đã hoàn thành, rachh-tay, chiều đi học ẩn dụ với bạn bè, nhờ bạn đưa ra cầu để nhảy bungee, cô giáo bí mật gọi mẹ mình. Thế là người mẹ đáng thương lại bỏ hết công việc đứng nắng chầu chực ở cổng trường rình con. Và mẹ nhắn tin cho mình

Nhiều lúc mình tự nhận bản thân ích kỷ, không muốn về nhà vì cái không khí hòa bình mỏng manh đó không biết khi nào sẽ nổ tung. Đi học xa, có những lúc ích kỷ nghĩ rằng đi xa cho khuất mắt để nhẹ nhàng hơn nên nhiều lần khong muốn về nhà, nhưng lúc nào cũng có đám mây vô định lang thang tà tà bay trên đầu mình, cứ khi nào mẹ mình nhắn tin, gọi điện là mình lại nơm nớp lo sợ. Mình là một overthinker chính hiệu, mình cũng nhạy cảm nên hay suy nghĩ nhiều. Mình biết người khổ nhất là bố mẹ mình và mình thương 2 ông bà vô cùng, ngày nào cũng phải nhẫn nhịn, chịu đựng, phải là mình có lẽ sẽ bị bức điên lên mất. Nhiều lúc nghĩ muốn làm sao kết phim luôn đi, chứ dày vò nhau như thế này qua ngày rộng tháng dài, tra tấn tinh thần nhau như thế thực sự quá khổ rồi... Nó không có cái quyền tự cho mình là nhất, nó không có cái privilege để ngồi lên đầu bố mẹ mình. Nhưng vì phần người của mình, mình biết bố mẹ nào cũng thương con, nếu kết phim thì bố mẹ mình sẽ thế nào, mình nghĩ thôi cũng sợ... Nên thôi.

Mình ở trường cũng có những thứ riêng để lo lắng, mình cũng tội lỗi lắm khi tháng nào cũng bào tiền bố mẹ, bố mẹ cho tiền ăn học mà lại không đạt được điểm cao, không đạt được mục tiêu. Không một giây phút nào mình không cảm thấy bản thân có lỗi và tự hỏi mình đã làm gì sai để bố mẹ phải khốn khổ thế này, mình stress về chuyện của mình, lo cho tương lai gần là làm sao qua môn liên quan đến toán ở đh mà mình không học được, và cả sau này bản thân sẽ làm gì... Nhưng mình chỉ giữ trong lòng, nặng nề lắm mà không dám kể lể cho ai. Mình đọc tin nhắn của mẹ mà bất lực muốn rụng rời, mình mệt mỏi lắm, mình lại càng thương bố mẹ và tự trách nhiều hơn. Nhưng mình không thể bảo mẹ mình ""đừng venting vì con đã stress lắm rồi"" được, vì ngoài mình ra, mẹ còn biết kể với ai nữa đâu?

Mình cũng chẳng biết phải giải quyết chuyện này như thế nào, mình cũng khó chịu lắm, nhưng mình chỉ có thể kiểm soát được những chuyện trong tầm kiểm soát mà thôi.

1kc44l1,1746089794.0,2025-05-01 08:56:34,"If you could return to the age of 17, what would you change? Hi everybody!
I am a 17 year old male student.
Since entering high school, I have been conscious of personal development. In 10th grade, I tried to study diligently. I stayed up late, woke up early, studied hard at school subjects, and even studied for the computer science exam. Results: I was an excellent student that year, and my exam results for excellent students were quite good. By year 11, I was even more ambitious. I strive to achieve high scores in every subject at school and take many extra classes...
But one day when I look back, I'm no longer the same as before:
1. Earning points like a machine has made me lose many things: 
- I depend a lot on someone - artificial intelligence to the point that even the most normal things I ask someone -&gt; I typed out the logic (like my common sense).
- I learn by rote; passively study and work -&gt; My logical thinking and synthetic thinking are no longer the same as before.
2. My health has seriously declined:
- I had thyroid disease and had to have part of it removed.
- Height is only 1m68, much shorter than his peers.
- skinny body.
- Face full of acne and dark circles. poor eating…
3. Social relationships are worse:
- I often lock myself in my room to study, so I rarely communicate with people -&gt; quite shunned in class.
- When I talk, I'm often judged as being uncharitable and unintelligent.
- Participation in extracurricular activities is also low.
=&gt; I realized that the things I tried to achieve didn't seem to have much meaning. I wonder what I really need to do to really improve myself?
Therefore, these days I am immersed in ""emptiness"". I don't know if I should continue doing what I did in the past, or change myself. If we change, what should we change?
If everyone could go back to the age of 17, what would they change? 
I sincerely thank you!
p/s: recently I also started to change. I've been practicing boxing for 2 months now. I also buy more beautiful clothes, learn how to take care of my skin, and eat healthier.
But regarding studying, I still don't know what to do next...","Nếu được trở về tuổi 17, mọi người sẽ thay đổi điều gì? Chào mọi người!
Em là một học sinh nam 17 tuổi.
Từ lúc bước chân vào ngôi trường cấp 3, e đã có ý thức về việc phát triển bản thân. Năm lớp 10, e cố gắng học tập thật siêng năng. Em thức khuya, dậy sớm, cắm đầu vào học thật chăm chỉ các môn học trên trường, thậm chí là ôn thi học sinh giỏi môn Tin học. Kết quả: e đạt học sinh xuất sắc trong năm đó, kết quả thi học sinh giỏi thì khá ổn. Đến năm 11, em còn tham vọng hơn nữa. Em nỗ lực để đạt được điểm cao ở trong mọi môn học trên trường va đi học nhiều lớp học thêm,…
Nhưng đến một ngày e nhìn lại, thì bản thân e đã ko còn như trước được nữa:
1. Việc cày điểm như một cái máy đã khiến e đánh mất đi nhiều thứ: 
- Em phụ thuộc rất nhiều vào AI - trí thông minh nhân tạo đến nỗi mà đến nhưng việc bình thường nhất mà e cũng vác lên hỏi AI -&gt; em đánh đi truc giác logic ( kiểu như common sense của mình)
- Em học vẹt; học tập, làm việc một cách thụ động -&gt; tư duy logic và tư duy tổng hợp của em không còn như xưa nữa.
2. Sức khoẻ em suy giảm trầm trọng:
- Em bị mắc tuyết giáp, phải cắt bỏ 1 phần.
- Chiều cao chỉ 1m68, thấp hơn nhiều so với bạn bè cùng trang lứa.
- cơ thể gầy guộc.
- Mặt nhiều mụn và nhiều quầng thâm. Ăn uống kém…
3. Quan hệ xã hội càng kém:
- Em hay nhốt mình trong phòng để học, vì vậy nên ít có giao tiếp với mọi người -&gt; khá xa lánh trong lớp.
- Khi nói chuyện thì e hay bị đánh giá là nói chuyện kém duyên, không thông minh.
- Các hoạt động ngoại khoá cũng ít tham gia.
=&gt; Em nhận ra là những thứ mà mình từng cố gắng đạt được, dường như nó cũng chẳng có nhiều ý nghĩa. Em tự tự hỏi điều mà mình thực sự cần làm để bản thân thực sự tốt lên là gì?
Do đó, những ngày này em bị chìm vào sự “trống rỗng” . Em không biết nên tiếp tục làm những cái trong quá khứ, hay thay đổi bản thân. Mà thay đổi thì nên thay đổi những gì?
Nếu mọi người được quay về tuổi 17, mọi người sẽ thay đổi những gì? 
Em xin chân thành cảm ơn!
P/s: Dạo gần đây e cũng bắt đầu thay đổi. Em đi tập boxing cũng được 2 tháng rồi. Em cũng mua thêm đồ đẹp, học chăm sóc da mặt, ăn uống healthy hơn.

1kyl21v,1748549969.0,2025-05-29 20:19:29,"Hello everyone, I wanted to come here to relieve myself a bit because I'm so stressed that I can't sleep... the thing is that I have a younger brother who is 4 years younger and this year he is preparing to take the c3 graduation exam. My brother and I don't get along and often have conflicts ranging from small to big things. Like other people, it goes away after a few times, but in my case, even though we are siblings, we always see each other as enemies just waiting to kill each other. But each house has its own scene...

Even though we cursed and shouted at each other, I still felt sorry for him because there weren't many brothers and sisters in the house. Besides, every time I scolded him and accidentally said harsh words to him, I was very sad and blamed myself for being an animal for saying bad words that hurt my brother. Then I took the initiative to make peace, not wanting anything too tense to happen. But because of age or some reason I can't understand, it never changes and not only with me but increasingly raises my voice with my parents (like my parents are not afraid of anyone, don't swear or curse, but their attitude is exactly like that). 

When he goes out, he is very grateful to people, sacrifices himself to fight for people, helps people in all kinds of ways, but when he comes home and does housework, he can't do anything, even when it's time to eat and bathe, he has to be urged and called a lot before he will come down. Doesn't help with housework at all. Even being a little jealous of family members 1. Even though he's a man, his constant babbling and talking is very annoying. Having a low level of education and talking too much really tortures the listener's brain.

He also wanted to work a few extra months during the summer with a salary of 5,6 million for 5 hours in the evening at a beer shop (making orders). Of course, he went to work to do well and have pocket money, not to force him to take the money back to buy this and that, but he also did not give his mother 1,2 hundred as a gift while my mother took care of food so that he could skip school to go play. Then, the times he was fined for traffic safety violations, he lost all his stupid money, but he also did not know how to think for her mother's sake. I only saw giving money to girls and having to change my phone model to be like the well-off kids in class. The house is not like other people's, but being able to study, eat, and sleep peacefully is good. I don't like it and I always just feel stupid and stupid.

Then I was almost expelled from school because the car had no mirrors, there were many cases. The climax was that today, he and I had a fight and argued. Later, I became silent and didn't say anything. As I mentioned above, he was very grumpy. I couldn't stand it anymore and punched him in the arm. After that, the two of them fought and literally broke their heads and foreheads, but I was able to punch him and before he let go, he punched him repeatedly in the head and face, in a dangerous area, 5 or 6 times. My mother came to his defense in time, so I stopped. Maybe people say I was right to punch him because I punched him first, but I admit I was wrong because I just fought. But that wasn't what caused the anger because then he saw that I was weak and couldn't do anything so he started cursing ""mmmm cmm"" right in front of my mother. It's his fault, he makes fun of me and every time I'm reminded, he has an attitude and complains. I'm also hot-tempered and can't help it, so that's what happened. I can ignore it 2 or 3 times, but it's always like that, I'm not a dog that can ignore it forever. As a child or grandchild, I talk to adults on equal terms, it's not just a joke, it's really rude, everyone. More and more, no one can tell him what to do.

After this time, I will be helpless and have more hatred and will definitely give up when he insults my mother like that. Thank you everyone for listening, I am very grateful for all your opinions 🙏","Chào mọi người, em muốn lên đây để giải toả đôi chút vì đến giờ bị căng thẳng quá không thể ngủ được… Chuyện là em có người em trai kém 4t và năm nay nó chuẩn bị thi tốt nghiệp c3. Em và em trai không hoà hợp thường xảy ra mâu thuẫn từ cái nhỏ đến cái lớn, như người ta thì 1 vài lần thì hết nhưng trường hợp của em thì có là chị em ruột thịt nhưng lúc nào cũng coi nhau như kẻ thù chỉ trực chờ để giết nhau. Nhưng mỗi nhà mỗi cảnh…

Có chửi có quát nhau nhưng em thì vẫn thương vì nhà không đông anh chị em gì, vả lại mỗi lần có mắng mà lỡ nặng lời với nó thì em đều rất buồn và tự trách là bản thân mình súc vật khi nói ra những lời lẽ không hay mà tổn thương đến em mình. Rồi em cũng chủ động làm hoà thôi không muốn chuyện gì xảy ra quá căng. Nhưng nó vì do độ tuổi hay 1 lý do gì em không thể hiểu mà không bao giờ chịu thay đổi và không chỉ với mỗi em mà càng ngày rất lên giọng với bố mẹ ( kiểu bố đời không sợ ai, không chửi bậy hay chửi rủa nhưng cái thái độ thì chính xác như vậy ) 

Ra ngoài nó rất tình nghĩa với thiên hạ, xả thân đánh nhau vì người ta, giúp người ta đủ kiểu mà về nhà việc nhà không làm nổi 1 cái gì kể cả đến giờ ăn, tắm cũng phải giục và gọi rất nhiều mới chịu xuống. Không giúp đỡ hộ hành việc nhà 1 tí nào. Thậm chí là soi mói tị nạnh người nhà chút 1. Đã thế là đàn ông con trai nhưng lèm bèm nói nhiều dai dẳng rất khó chịu. Cái trình độ học vấn đã thấp mà nói nhiều thì thực sự là tra tấn não người nghe.

Nó cũng đòi đi làm thêm mấy tháng hè lương 5 6tr trong 5 tiếng buổi tối ở quán bia (làm order), tất nhiên thì nó đi làm để cho tốt rồi có tiền tiêu vặt chứ không bắt nó phải cho phải cầm tiền về phải mua này mua kia nhưng cũng không cho mẹ được 1 2 trăm làm quà trong khi mẹ em lo ăn để nó trốn học đi chơi, rồi những lần bị phạt vi phạm an toàn giao thông mất toàn tiền ngu nhưng nó cũng không biết suy nghĩ vì mẹ. Chỉ thấy cầm tiền cho gái và phải đổi đời điện thoại cho bằng mấy đứa nhà khá giả trong lớp. Nhà không như người ta nhưng được học hành ăn no ngủ yên là tốt k thích lại lúc nào cũng chỉ thấy đú đởn và sĩ.

Rồi là suýt bị đuổi học vì xe không gương, rất nhiều vụ. Còn đỉnh điểm là hôm nay em với nó cũng xích mích và cãi nhau, em về sau im lặng và không nói gì và như em đã đề cập ở trên thì nó rất lèm bèm, em không thể nhịn được nữa và đã đấm vào tay nó. Sau đó thành cả 2 đánh nhau sứt đầu mẻ trán đúng nghĩa đen luôn, nhưng em đấm dc nó cái  còn chưa buông tay đã bị nó đấm liên tiếp vào đầu mặt, chỗ hiểm 5 6 cái, mẹ em vào bênh kịp nên đã thôi. Có thể mọi người bảo em ăn đấm là đúng vì em đấm nó trước, em nhận em sai luôn vì tại em mới có đánh nhau. Nhưng cái đấy không phải cái gây phẫn nộ vì sau đấy nó thấy em yếu thế không thể làm gì nên bắt đầu chửi bậy “đmm cmm” ngay trước mặt mẹ em. Là nó sai nó cợt nhả mọi lúc bị nhắc nhở thì thái độ và lèm bèm, em cũng nóng tính và không thể nhịn đc nên đã vậy. 2  3 lần thì bỏ qua được chứ lúc nào cũng thế thì em không phải là con chó mà bỏ qua được mãi. Phận là con cháu, em nhưng nói chuyện ngang hàng mất dạy với người lớn, nó không phải là trêu đùa mà mất dạy thật mọi người ạ, càng ngày không ai bảo ban được nó

Sau lần này thì em cũng bất lực và sinh thù hằn nhiều hơn và chắc chắn sẽ từ mặt  khi nó xúc phạm mẹ mình như vậy. Cảm ơn mọi người đã lắng nghe, mọi ý kiến em đều rất biết ơn 🙏 ","hello everyone , i want come here relieve myself a bit because i'm stress i can't sleep ... thing i have a young brother who 4 year young year he prepare take c3 graduation exam . my brother i don't get along often have conflict range from small big thing . like other people , go away after a few time , my case , even though we sibling , we always see each other a enemy just wait kill each other . each house have own scene ... even though we curse shout each other , i still felt sorry him because there weren't many brother sister house . besides , every time i scold him accidentally say harsh word him , i very sad blame myself an animal say bad word hurt my brother . then i take initiative make peace , not want anything too tense happen . because age some reason i can't understand , never change not only me increasingly raise my voice my parent ( like my parent not afraid anyone , don't swear curse , their attitude exactly like ). when he go out , he very grateful people , sacrifice himself fight people , help people all kind way , when he come home do housework , he can't do anything , even when it's time eat bathe , he have urge call a lot before he will come down . doesn't help housework all . even a little jealous family member 1 . even though he's a man , his constant babbling talk very annoy . have a low level education talk too much really torture listener's brain . he also want work a few extra month during summer a salary 5 , 6 million 5 hour evening a beer shop ( make order ). course , he go work do well have pocket money , not force him take money back buy , he also do not give his mother 1 , 2 hundred a a gift while my mother take care food he could skip school go play . then , time he fin traffic safety violation , he lose all his stupid money , he also do not know how think her mother's sake . i only saw give money girl have change my phone model like well - off kid class . house not like other people's , able study , eat , sleep peacefully good . i don't like i always just feel stupid stupid . then i almost expel from school because car have no mirror , there many case . climax today , he i have a fight argue . later , i become silent didn't say anything . a i mention above , he very grumpy . i couldn't stand anymore punch him arm . after , two them fought literally break their head forehead , i able punch him before he let go , he punch him repeatedly head face , a dangerous area , 5 6 time . my mother come his defense time , i stop . maybe people say i right punch him because i punch him first , i admit i wrong because i just fight . wasn't what cause anger because then he saw i weak couldn't do anything he start curse "" mmmm cmm "" right front my mother . it's his fault , he make fun me every time i'm remind , he have an attitude complains . i'm also hot - temper can't help , that's what happen . i can ignore 2 3 time , it's always like , i'm not a dog can ignore forever . a a child grandchild , i talk adult equal term , it's not just a joke , it's really rude , everyone . more more , no one can tell him what do . after time , i will helpless have more hatred will definitely give up when he insult my mother like . thank you everyone listen , i very grateful all your opinion",Depression

At the moment, I really feel empty and helpless because of my uselessness, not knowing where the future is headed. Overall, it all started at the beginning of high school, I had an argument with a guy in class. Then he invited everyone in the class to start isolating me even though it was nothing. Nothing too big, I guarantee this. The friends I used to be quite close to suddenly turned their backs on me, from then on I also started to withdraw, my studies declined, and I became an idiot, only knowing about games and nonsense music every day and night. When it was time to take the university entrance exam, I just randomly chose an IT major even though I didn't understand much about it. My score wasn't too low. I chose to study at a very ordinary school in Hanoi. When I went to university, the cycle continued, the laziness and weakness that had followed me since my high school years were like that. I studied promiscuously, even failing a few subjects in an unspeakably stupid way. Now in my 4th year, my skills are poor, my health is weak, in general, I am completely negative. All this mess originates from myself. I created this thread of course not expecting to be comforted or comforted at all, I just hope everyone can curse less, criticize whatever they want so I can do it again.

1jbyonc,1742055445.0,2025-03-15 16:17:25,"Need advice to get out of torment Hello everyone, I'm currently a 2nd year student and really need advice. I'm having a problem that I know that if I don't talk about it, I don't know how long it will last. But I feel like I can't understand myself. If the writing is still confusing, I hope everyone will sympathize.

Because this story of mine is very chaotic between elements, I would like to summarize my characteristics before going into the story to easily express it. Brief background about myself: never self-taught, quite bright but with a superficial learning style, heavily influenced by games, struggled internally many times but still got there, attended a district specialized school in middle school but did not take the entrance exam to a provincial specialized school in high school and studied at a village school, took the university entrance exam with a major that was not as expected and is having problems with scores.
First of all, I want to talk about my persistent torment, since middle school, when I sat in school just doing homework. But I always completed it passively, only finishing it the night before the test. Before that, I mostly just slept and played games. In class, because I can't play games, I'm quite focused on the lesson. Normally, teachers give exercises with 3 levels: easy, medium and difficult. Because I'm quite receptive, I often ignore everything and just focus on difficult lessons. I still maintain this habit even when studying for university exams. There are times when I'm quite complacent because I hardly study at home but can still do difficult lessons, while my classmates, even though they are diligent and diligent at home, still can't learn like me. But sometimes I feel disappointed when I remember middle school, it was all because of games. Because it is a specialized school, there are difficult exercises that cannot be solved all day long. There are many friends who were at the same level as me at first, but they were very determined. They could study and read more books as soon as they got home from school, so gradually they were able to do the exercises that I couldn't do. I also feel jealous and jealous of myself, but every time I come home from school I still do it because at that time I still only prioritize the game. The torment that I kept ignoring followed me all four years of middle school.
Even though I was lazy, in middle school and high school, many teachers gave regular homework plus extra classes, so my scores weren't bad. But when it comes to college, the time spent studying in the classroom becomes much less. And because of that freedom, when I'm in my room, I don't study at all.

Maybe people will think that I used that time to play games again. But the truth is it's much worse than that. I quit the game for a while. After quitting the game, I really thought about studying in my free time. But there seems to be an invisible resistance preventing that.

I can surf Facebook and watch YouTube all day aimlessly. It sounds quite similar to some others these days, but my biggest difference from the rest is my personality in class and when I leave. If I were in class after 1 or 2 stressful lessons, most of the class would lie down on their desks, but I never do that. In contrast to them, I am always alert when I go to class but become restless when I am at home. I was also heavily influenced by the game because it seemed like I had a very high ego in the game. If I reach my goal but can't, I will try by all means. At the peak, I played the game from 8am to 8pm without eating breakfast or lunch (because I was too bitter) until I reached my goal. After that, I tried to quit the game but my studying situation still didn't get better. Having gone through more than 3 semesters of university, I never do homework without a test and only review for exams 1-2 days before the exam. Some subjects are lucky to still get an A, A+ due to studying in class, but if a subject is poorly understood and difficult, it is only c and d and therefore my score is lower than most of my classmates, because most of them are hardworking, especially the girls. Now my 8-year torment is even greater because now I can no longer just study in school and still get high scores because university knowledge is much more serious than in high school. 
 
Now I feel more useless than ever. Besides some of you who may not be too bright but are very hard-working, even those who don't study still have their own plans like working part-time, flirting, and hanging out rather than sitting still. It's just me who is struggling with the seemingly simple task of just sitting at a desk but it seems to be very difficult. I have tried methods such as framing, writing letters to comfort myself, collecting motivational quotes, even injecting positive elements into my head.","Cần xin lời khuyên để thoát khỏi sự dằn vặt Chào mọi người, hiện em đang là sinh viên năm 2 đang rất cần lời khuyên. Em đang gặp vấn đề mà em biết rằng nếu không nói ra thì em không thể biết nó sẽ còn kéo dài đến lúc nào nữa. Nhưng em đang cảm thấy không thể hiểu nổi bản thân mình. Nếu hành văn còn lủng củng mong mọi người thông cảm ạ.

Vì chuyện này của em nó rất hỗn loạn giữa các yếu tố nên em xin tóm tắt đặc điểm của bản thân rồi mới đi vào câu chuyện để dễ dàng diễn đạt ạ. Sơ qua về bản thân : chưa bao giờ tự học, khá sáng dạ nhưng cách học hời hợt, bị ảnh hưởng nặng từ game, đấu tranh nội tâm rất nhiều lần nhưng vẫn đâu lại vào đấy, cấp 2 học trường chuyên trong huyện nhưng cấp 3 không thi vào trường chuyên của tỉnh và học ở trường làng, thi vào đại học với chuyên ngành không như nguyện vọng và đang gặp vấn đề về điểm số.
Trước tiên em muốn kể về sự dằn vặt dai dẳng của mình, từ cấp 2 những lúc em ngồi học chỉ là làm bài tập về nhà. Nhưng em luôn hoàn thành 1 cách thụ động, chỉ hoàn thành từ buổi tối hôm trước ngày kiểm tra. Thời gian trước đó đa phần em chỉ ngủ và chơi game. Còn ở trên lớp, vì không chơi game được nên em khá tập trung vào bài học. Thông thường thầy cô ra bài tập sẽ có đủ 3 mức dễ vừa và khó. Vì em tiếp thu cũng khá nên thường bỏ qua hết mà chỉ tập trung vào bài khó, em vẫn duy trì thói quen này cả lúc ôn thi đại học. Có những lúc em khá tự mãn bởi vì mình ở nhà gần như không học nhưng vẫn có thể làm được bài khó, còn mấy đứa bạn trong lớp cho dù nó siêng và chăm chỉ ở nhà vẫn không tiếp thu được như mình. Nhưng cũng có lúc em lại thấy thất vọng khi nhớ đến thời cấp 2, cũng chỉ tại game mà ra. Vì là trường chuyên nên có những bài tập khó có thể giải cả buổi cũng không ra. Có nhiều đứa bạn ban đầu cũng khá ngang em nhưng bọn nó rất quyết tâm, có thể vừa đi học về đã học bài và đọc thêm sách nên dần dần có thể làm được những bài tập mà em lại không làm được. Em cũng thấy ghen tỵ và ganh ghét bản thân nhưng mỗi lần đi học về là vẫn đâu lại vào đấy vì lúc đó em vẫn chỉ ưu tiên cho game. Sự dằn vặt nhưng lại cứ bỏ qua đấy theo suốt em cả 4 năm học cấp 2.
Mặc dù em lười nhác là vậy nhưng ở cấp 2 và cả cấp 3 thời gian học trên trường rất nhiều thầy cô ra bài tập thường xuyên cộng với cả việc học thêm nên điểm số của em cũng không hề tệ. Nhưng đến lúc lên đại học, thời gian học trên giảng đường trở nên ít hơn nhiều. Và chính vì sự tự do đó nên em lúc ở trong phòng lại không hề học.

Có thể mọi người sẽ nghĩ rằng em lại dùng thời gian đó cày game. Nhưng sự thật nó còn tệ hơn thế nhiều. Em đã bỏ game được một thời gian. Sau khi bỏ game em thật sự có nghĩ đến việc học lúc rảnh. Nhưng dường như có một lực cản vô hình ngăn cản điều đó.

Em có thể lướt fb, xem youtube cả buổi một cách vô định. Nghe có vẻ khá giống một số khác hiện nay nhưng điểm khác biệt lớn nhất của em so với phần còn lại là tính cách của em trên lớp và lúc đi về. Nếu như ở trên lớp sau 1 2 tiết học căng thẳng đa phần cả lớp sẽ nằm dài trên bàn nhưng em không bao giờ như vậy. Ngược lại với họ em luôn tỉnh táo khi đến lớp nhưng lại trở nên vô định lúc ở nhà. Em còn bị ảnh hưởng nặng bởi game đó là dường như trong game em lại có cái tôi rất cao. Nếu đã đạt mục tiêu mà không được em sẽ cố bằng mọi cách. Đỉnh điểm là em đã chơi game từ 8h sáng đến 8h tối mà không ăn sáng và ăn trưa (vì quá cay cú) chỉ đến khi đạt mục đích. Sau đấy em đã cố bỏ game nhưng tình hình học của em vẫn không khá hơn. Đã trải qua hơn 3 kì đại học em không bao giờ làm bài tập nếu không kiểm tra và chỉ ôn thi 1 -2 ngày trước ngày thi, có môn may mắn vẫn được A, A+ do có học trên lớp nhưng nếu môn nào tiếp thu kém và khó thì cũng chỉ C và D và do đó điểm của em đang thấp hơn đa phần những bạn trong lớp, vì đa số đều chăm chỉ đặc biệt là các bạn nữ. Bây giờ nỗi dằn vặt suốt 8 năm của em lại càng lớn hơn vì bây giờ không còn có thể chỉ học trên trường mà vẫn có thể điểm cao được vì kiến thức đại học nghiêm túc hơn nhiều so với thời phổ thông. 
 
Giờ em đang cảm thấy bản thân trở nên vô dụng hơn bao giờ hết. Bên cạnh một số bạn có thể không được quá sáng dạ nhưng họ rất chăm chỉ, thì thậm chí những bạn không học vẫn đang có dự định riêng cho mình như đi làm thêm, tán tỉnh, chơi bời chứ không ngồi yên một chỗ. Chỉ có em đang là người đang vật lộn với việc tưởng chừng rất đơn giản là chỉ cần ngồi vào bàn học nhưng dường như rất khó khăn. Em đã cố thử các phương pháp như framing, tự viết thư an ủi bản thân, sưu tầm motivation quotes thậm chí là tiêm vào đầu những yếu tố tích cực độc hại (bản thân mình còn lành lặn, ngoài kia còn bao nhiêu người không được như mình …) nhưng rồi khi thất bại hậu quả của nó lại càng trầm trọng hơn. Em chỉ thấy vấn đề của mình là chỉ có thể làm việc khi có người khác thúc giục sau lưng nhưng lại không thể tự cứu lấy bản thân mình, giống như EQ đang ở mức âm vô cùng.

134eyr8,1682923660.0,2023-05-01 06:47:40,"Do whatever you want, but don't disobey your parents. \[it's a long story\] I was a 19 year old bastard (hopefully not discriminated against), I fell to the bottom of society because I didn't listen to my parents.

From childhood to adulthood, my parents always directed me to focus on studying, whether or not other things are important is not important. Well, that's why I only know how to study, life is very peaceful, I always go to specialized schools and select classes. When I went to high school, I wanted to change and develop myself more, because I was surrounded by talented and talented people. That's why I participated in many extracurricular activities, doing this and that to find out what I liked, and even planned to study abroad.

My parents are almost 70 years old so they're a bit prejudiced, plus they learned from their relatives' experience and when I was in 12th grade there was also a covid outbreak so they didn't let me go. But I know, actually it's because my parents don't trust me because they think I lack life experience, I'm not smart and I'm introverted. All my efforts up to the last minute were not approved, and my parents directed me to pursue the medical field to continue the family business even though I felt I was suitable for the social sector.

At that time, when I was in 12th grade studying online, I felt bored so I didn't put all my effort into studying. I studied to pass the class and I also helped a lot with my homework for two of my close friends (middle school friends). At the end of the 1st grade of 12th grade, I started playing Lien Quan (before that I never played games) and the climax was that I lent 4x million to a friend (of the 2 above). I don't know why I did that. You asked me to borrow too much, so I tried to help and took my savings, Ielts exam money, tuition money + asked my parents to lend me money. My parents didn't know anything. After 2 weeks of playing games, they discovered I was playing games so they checked my phone and found out I lent them money.

Well, my parents lost faith, were disappointed, cursed a lot and confiscated my phone until I finished taking the exam. Because I didn't study anything, I failed YDS and only passed bk, ftu, ueh, etc., so my parents were devastated. I enrolled in a university to avoid the entrance exam and to save my parents from losing face because of this underground situation. Up to now, I'm still studying for the exam, and I have almost 2 months left until I take the exam again. I'm quite pressured because the field I'm studying and the field I'm about to retake are both fields I don't like.

Last year, my mom signed me up for the gym and I tried really hard, but she didn't see any improvement in my practice, so she stopped paying me to workout. My sister also sent her CV to apply for a job for me to work as an English teaching assistant, to avoid me sitting idle at home (even though I do a lot of housework at home). When I went to work, seeing that I was busy with school, my mother asked me to quit, but I still didn't quit because my contract would be over in 6 months. So there were a few times when I pretended to go to school but to work, my contract ended last month so I quit.

Now is the time to reach the bottom of society. For more than a year, I've been quite desperate, because my parents don't trust me. Before, I didn't have my own room, I slept with my mom, and now my parents ask me to always open the door to make it easier to go back and forth to check. My two older sisters are also 30 years old, so they think the same way as their parents and help them manage and control my phone. Last year, my phone was checked and I found out I was looking at gay porn on Twitter and telegram, so I got cursed a lot (that was the only time I was cursed and I turned it back on, other times I pretended not to hear).

My mom sleeps with me to make it easier for me to not play games. At night I have to go to bed early with her and in the morning she turns off my alarm so I often wake up late. I often see my parents do a lot of housework so they often help out a lot, but they tell me to worry about studying, don't do chores. My parents don't like each other either, they just live together so they don't talk. For more than a year now, my dad has been preparing food for me, but the food is always the same, not delicious, and my dad usually takes a lot so I can't eat it so I have to try. Mom makes food that no one wants to eat much of, so every night there's leftover food, I try to eat it all. I don't dare to ask for anything or give comments or compliments, because I'm so happy to eat it, but I don't dare to ask for it. Most of my parents would like to buy clothes and shoes for me, so I can't choose them myself, and I also don't dare ask for money to buy them myself. I suggested that I do these things myself. I also sneak up early to do housework many times, but my parents say that I can't do big things when I do these little chores.

I'm a failure. I want to change and improve myself, but the more I do it and the more I argue with my parents, the worse the results become. I have average looks but because of my introversion and poor speaking style, my friends only hung around for a while and then all of them left me. The people I once helped and respected have all left me. There are also people who have just come into contact with me like friends on the phone, colleagues,... who already hate me","Làm gì thì làm nhưng đừng cãi lời bố mẹ \[CHUYỆN DÀI LẮMMM\]Tui 19t là bot răm (hy vọng kh bị kì thị), tui đã rớt xuống đáy xã hội vì không nghe lời bố mẹ.

Từ nhỏ đến lớn thì bố mẹ luôn định hướng tui tập trung học hành, mấy cái khác có hay không không quan trọng. Ờm cũng vì thế mà tui chỉ biết học thôi, cuộc sống rất êm đềm, luôn học trường chuyên lớp chọn. Lên cấp 3 kiểu tui muốn thay đổi và phát triển bản thân hơn, tại xung quanh toàn người giỏi giang và tài năng. Nên tui mới tham gia nhiều hoạt động ngoại khóa, làm này làm nọ để tìm xem bản thân mình thích gì, còn định đi du học nữa chứ.

Bố mẹ tui thì kiểu gần 70 tuổi rồi nên hơi định kiến, với lại rút kinh nghiệm từ họ hàng và lúc tui lớp 12 cũng đang bùng dịch COVID nên hong cho tui đi. Nhưng tui biết, thật ra là do bố mẹ hong tin tưởng tui vì tui nghĩ tui thiếu kinh nghiệm sống, tui không lanh lẹ và tui hướng nội đó. Mọi cố gắng của tui tới phút chót đã không được đồng ý, và bố mẹ thì định hướng tui theo ngành Y để nối nghiệp gia đình dù tui thấy mình hợp với các khối ngành xã hội.

Lúc đó lên lớp 12 học Online, tui thấy chán nản đồ nên tui không dốc hết sức để học á. Tui học để qua môn và tui cũng làm bài giúp khá nhiều cho 2 bạn tui chơi thân (bạn cấp 2). Hết HK1 lớp 12 tui còn bắt đầu chơi Liên Quân (trước đó tui kh chơi game) và đỉnh điểm là tui cho 1 bạn (trong 2 bạn trên) mượn tiền 4x triệu. Không biết sao tui làm vậy luôn, bạn hỏi mượn dữ quá nên tui ráng giúp và lấy tiền tiết kiệm, tiền thi IELTS, tiền học phí + xin thêm bố mẹ để cho mượn. Bố mẹ tui đã ko biết gì, sau 2 tuần chơi game thì mới phát hiện tui chơi game nên kiểm tra điện thoại và phát hiện tui cho mượn tiền.

Ờ thì bố mẹ mất niềm tin, thất vọng, chửi dữ lắm và tịch thu điện thoại tới khi tui thi ĐH xong. Do không học hành gì nên rớt YDS, chỉ xét tuyển đậu BK, FTU, UEH,... đồ thôi nên bố mẹ suy sụp lắm. Tui nhập học đại 1 trường để né đi NVQS và để bố mẹ đỡ mất mặt vì nước đi xuống lòng đất này. Đến giờ tui vẫn vừa học ĐH vừa ôn thi lại, còn gần 2 tháng nữa sẽ thi lại. Tui khá áp lực tại vì ngành tui đang học và ngành tui sắp thi lại đều là 2 ngành tui ko thích.

Năm ngoái mẹ đăng ký tui tập gym và tui đã rất cố nhưng mà thấy tui tập ko cải thiện nên mẹ ko đóng tiền cho tui tập nữa. Chị tui cũng tự gửi CV để xin việc cho tui làm thêm trợ giảng tiếng Anh, để tránh tui ăn không ngồi rồi ở nhà (dù ở nhà tui làm việc nhà rất nhiều). Lúc tui đi làm, thấy tui bận học nên mẹ kêu tui nghỉ mà tui vẫn không nghỉ vì 6 tháng mới hết hợp đồng. Vậy nên có mấy lần tui giả bộ đi học nhưng để đi làm, tháng trước mới hết hợp đồng nên tui mới nghỉ.

Giờ mới tới khúc đáy xã hội. Trong khoảng thời gian hơn 1 năm rồi thì tui khá tuyệt vọng, tại bố mẹ tui ko tin tưởng tui á. Trước giờ tui ko có phòng riêng, ngủ chung với mẹ và giờ bố mẹ kêu tui luôn mở cửa phòng để dễ đi qua đi lại kiểm tra. 2 chị tui cũng &gt;30 rồi nên là cũng cùng suy nghĩ với ba mẹ nên giúp bố mẹ quản lý và kiểm tra điện thoại tui. Năm ngoái tui bị kiểm tra điện thoại và phát hiện coi mấy thứ tà răm của gay trên Twitter, Telegram nên bị chửi dữ lắm (đó là lần duy nhất tui bị chửi mà tui bật lại, còn mấy lần chửi khác thì tui giả bộ ko nghe).

Mẹ tui ngủ chung để dễ quản cho tui ko chơi game á, tối tui phải ngủ sớm theo mẹ và sáng mẹ tắt báo thức của tui nên tui thường bị dậy muộn. Tui thường thấy bố mẹ làm việc nhà cực nên hay phụ nhiều nhưng mà bố mẹ kêu là lo học đi, đừng làm chuyện lặt vặt. Bố mẹ tui cũng không ưa nhau, chỉ sống với nhau nên không nói chuyện. Từ hơn 1 năm nay là bố chuẩn bị đồ ăn cho tui á nhưng mà đồ ăn cứ bị lặp đi lặp lại, ko ngon mà bố tui thường lấy nhiều nên tui ko ăn nổi cũng phải ráng. Mẹ thì làm đồ ăn mà ko ai muốn ăn nhiều nên mỗi tối có đồ ăn dư là tui đều ráng ăn hết. Tui ko dám đòi hỏi hay góp ý chê khen gì, tại có ăn là mừng lắm rồi chứ ko dám đòi hỏi. Quần áo giày dép thì đa phần bố mẹ sẽ thích mua về cho tui nên tui ko đc tự chọn, cũng ko dám xin tiền tự mua á. Mấy cái đó tui có đề xuất là tui tự làm, việc nhà cũng có nhiều lần lén dậy sớm làm nhưng mà bố mẹ kêu là làm mấy việc vặt là sao này ko làm đc việc lớn.

Tui là thằng thất bại. Tui muốn thay đổi và cải thiện bản thân nhưng mà càng làm, càng cãi lời bố mẹ thì kết quả càng tệ. Tui có ngoại hình trung bình thôi nhưng do hướng nội, cách ăn nói kém nên bạn bè chơi chỉ đc 1 thời gian rồi đều bỏ tui hết. Những người tui từng giúp hết mình và trân trọng giờ đều rời bỏ tui hết. Còn có những người mới tiếp xúc với tui như bạn trên ĐH, đồng nghiệp,... mà đã ghét tui rồi, tui nghĩ xung quanh có rất nhiều người ghét tui. Giờ đây tui chỉ có 1 mình và kh tâm sự được với ai. Tui rất hối hận vì ban đầu đã không nghe theo lời bố mẹ để cuộc sống dễ dàng hơn. Bố mẹ là người đi trước và có nhiều kinh nghiệm nên tốt nhất là hãy nghe theo. Tui vẫn rất biết ơn bố mẹ vì đã chăm lo và cho tui tiền xài nên ko thể nào ghét bố mẹ đc.","do whatever you want , don't disobey your parent . \[ it's a long story \] i a 19 year old bastard ( hopefully not discriminate against ), i fell bottom society because i didn't listen my parent . from childhood adulthood , my parent always direct me focus study , whether not other thing important not important . well , that's why i only know how study , life very peaceful , i always go specialize school select class . when i go high school , i want change develop myself more , because i surround talented talented people . that's why i participate many extracurricular activity , do find out what i like , even plan study abroad . my parent almost 70 year old they're a bit prejudiced , plus they learn from their relative ' experience when i 12th grade there also a covid outbreak they didn't let me go . i know , actually it's because my parent don't trust me because they think i lack life experience , i'm not smart i'm introvert . all my effort up last minute not approve , my parent direct me pursue medical field continue family business even though i felt i suitable social sector . time , when i 12th grade study online , i felt bore i didn't put all my effort into study . i study pass class i also help a lot my homework two my close friend ( middle school friend ). end 1st grade 12th grade , i start play lien quan ( before i never play game ) climax i lend 4x million a friend ( 2 above ). i don't know why i do . you ask me borrow too much , i try help take my saving , ielts exam money , tuition money + ask my parent lend me money . my parent didn't know anything . after 2 week play game , they discover i play game they check my phone find out i lend them money . well , my parent lose faith , disappoint , curse a lot confiscate my phone until i finish take exam . because i didn't study anything , i fail yds only pass bk , ftu , ueh , etc ., my parent devastate . i enrol a university avoid entrance exam save my parent from lose face because underground situation . up now , i'm still study exam , i have almost 2 month leave until i take exam again . i'm quite pressured because field i'm study field i'm about retake both field i don't like . last year , my mom sign me up gym i try really hard , she didn't see any improvement my practice , she stop pay me workout . my sister also send her cv apply a job me work a an english teaching assistant , avoid me sit idle home ( even though i do a lot housework home ). when i go work , see i busy school , my mother ask me quit , i still didn't quit because my contract would over 6 month . there a few time when i pretend go school work , my contract end last month i quit . now time reach bottom society . more than a year , i've quite desperate , because my parent don't trust me . before , i didn't have my own room , i sleep my mom , now my parent ask me always open door make easy go back forth check . my two old sister also 30 year old , they think same way a their parent help them manage control my phone . last year , my phone check i find out i look gay porn twitter telegram , i get curse a lot ( only time i curse i turn back , other time i pretend not hear ). my mom sleep me make easy me not play game . night i have go bed early her morning she turn off my alarm i often wake up late . i often see my parent do a lot housework they often help out a lot , they tell me worry about study , don't do chore . my parent don't like each other either , they just live together they don't talk . more than a year now , my dad have prepare food me , food always same , not delicious , my dad usually take a lot i can't eat i have try . mom make food no one want eat much , every night there's leftover food , i try eat all . i don't dare ask anything give comment compliment , because i'm happy eat , i don't dare ask . most my parent would like buy clothes shoe me , i can't choose them myself , i also don't dare ask money buy them myself . i suggest i do these thing myself . i also sneak up early do housework many time , my parent say i can't do big thing when i do these little chore . i'm a failure . i want change improve myself , more i do more i argue my parent , bad result become . i have average look because my introversion poor speaking style , my friend only hang around a while then all them leave me . people i once help respect have all leave me . there also people who have just come into contact me like friend phone , colleague ,... who already hate me",Depression

After 1 year of working, I lost direction because I worked in the wrong field. I feel like I don't like my current job and I'm not motivated. The salary of 10 million is just enough to survive day by day in Hanoi. Recently, I have been thinking about trying to study foreign languages ​​to pursue a career in medical interpretation.

When I was in my 2nd grade, I took the biology exam and won first prize at the city level. I realized that I had an interest in the medical field, but when I was in my 3rd grade, when I chose the dh exam block, I didn't follow block b anymore. At that time, no one guided me and I didn't really study carefully. I didn't study natural subjects well (on the other hand, I found myself thinking and calculating numbers quite slow), so I decided to change majors. At that time, I thought only doctors, pharmacists, and nurses were working in healthcare, and if I tried hard, I wouldn't be able to get high scores to be able to get into a top medical university, so I decided to change direction.

I'm currently in a pretty serious crisis and seriously thinking and looking at what I really like, I realized that I still want to do things related to medicine and health. I would like to ask for advice from those currently pursuing this field on the necessary factors to be able to pursue this field. Is it too late at age 23 to start again?","Xin tư vấn về ngành Biên/Phiên dịch mảng y tế Em chào anh chị ạ, em mới ra trường đi làm 1 năm, em tốt nghiệp bằng giỏi của USSH.

Gần đây em có suy nghĩ sẽ cố gắng đi học ngoại ngữ để theo đuổi ngành phiên dịch mảng y tế.

Hồi c2 em từng thi HSG môn Sinh và đạt giải nhất cấp TP, em tự nhận thấy có bản thân có sự yêu thích với lĩnh vực y tế nhưng lên c3 lúc chọn khối thi dh, em đã không theo khối B nữa. Lúc đấy không có ai định hướng em và em cũng không thực sự tìm hiểu kĩ, em không học tốt các môn tự nhiên ( kém là đằng khác, em tự nhận thấy mình tư duy tính toán con số khá chậm ) nên em đã quyết định chuyển khối. Lúc đấy em chỉ nghĩ làm y tế chỉ có các bác sĩ, dược sĩ, y tá và nếu cố gắng học cũng không thể đạt điểm số cao để có thể đỗ vào trường đại học top của ngành y dược được nên đã quyết định chuyển định hướng.

Hiện tại em bị khủng hoảng khá nặng và nghiêm túc suy nghĩ và nhìn nhận xem bản thân thực sự thích gì thì em nhận ra em vẫn muốn được làm những gì liên quan đến y tế, sức khỏe.

Hello everyone, I'm 24 years old and studying for a master's degree in technology in Norway. I have a problem: I feel like I don't have much motivation to study, and it's difficult to concentrate. I experienced burn out at the end of my third year of college, and from then on I felt like I was no longer enthusiastic about studying, and my concentration was poor. If before, I always went to class and did all my homework, always following the rules and regulations set by the teacher, then from that time of burnout, I was ready to quit school and copy over the course 🫠🫠. My last year of college was also unremarkable, and then I applied to continue studying, according to the plan I had set out in previous years. Now I'm in the 2nd semester of the master's, in the 1st semester my score is quite low, 3/5. This semester has only been over a month, but I find it difficult to concentrate, lack motivation,... I've tried many things since I burned out, swimming, going to the gym, playing chess, drawing, reading, or going for a walk to get some fresh air,... (to regulate my emotions, because I'm afraid of burning out again, but it seems like I'm so afraid of it happening again, so now it's hard to stand the stress. Last semester I was able to try the first one, but the winter in Northern Europe is coming. After that, I was scared again, so I told myself to let myself relax a bit, then try harder next time. This time, I feel like I'm about to fail the class.) Everyone, please give me your opinion on what I should do to be able to focus and get motivated again. In addition to the things I mentioned above: practicing gum, swimming, drawing,... whichever one I choose to do, I will get used to it instead of dispersing a little of each, I think that will be better.

Em có 1 vấn đề là em cảm giác không có nhiều động lực để học, rất khó tập trung. Em từng bị burn out từ cuối năm 3 đại học, và từ đấy em cảm giác không còn nhiệt huyết với việc học nữa, tập trung cũng kém đi, nếu như trước đấy em lúc nào cũng lên lớp làm bài tập đầy đủ, luôn làm theo quy tắc và quy định giáo viên đề ra, thì từ khoảng thời gian burnout ấy, em sẵn sàng nghỉ học, chép bài qua môn 🫠🫠. Năm cuối đại học của em cũng không có gì nổi bật, và sau đấy em apply để đi học tiếp, theo kế hoạch em đã đề ra từ những năm trước. Giờ em đang ở kì 2 của Master, kì 1 thì điểm của em khá thấp, 3/5. Kì này mới được hơn 1 tháng, nhưng mà em thấy khó tập trung được, thiếu động lực,... Em cũng thử nhiều thứ từ lúc bị burn out đến giờ, bơi, tập gym, chơi cờ, vẽ , đọc sách, hay đi dạo để hít thở không khí,... ( để điều chỉnh cảm xúc, vì em sợ lại bị burn out thêm lần nữa, nhưng mà có vẻ em sợ vụ ấy xảy ra lần nữa quá, nên giờ khó mà chịu nổi căng thẳng, kì trước cũng cố được đợt đầu, nhưng mùa đông ở Bắc Âu đến xong, em lại sợ, thế là tự nhủ là để bản thân thoải mái chút, rồi kì sau quen rồi thì cố gắng sau. Kì này thì em đang thấy lại sắp lẹt đẹt qua môn rồi). Mọi người cho em xin ý kiến xem em nên làm thế nào để có thể tập trung và có động lực trở lại với ạ.

Hello everyone, I (male, straight) am 18 years old, 2k6 years old and I would like to briefly tell you about my life until now. The article will be long, similar to an autobiography, but this is my first time using reddit so the writing may be choppy. I also want everyone to read the entire article so they can give me feedback on what I should do next, thank you very much.

1.      early childhood

My parents often push me to go out to the neighborhood to play, but I'm very shy and I can't go out with my friends like normal because every time I go out, I often feel very uncomfortable. I'm afraid to interact with other people, especially many people (for no reason and the friends are all friendly), so I usually stay at home and my parents often complain about it. I also can't eat too much, I can't swallow any food and vomit it right away-&gt;I'm malnourished. At that time, my parents often beat me, but those beatings still haunt me to this day, but I still sympathize because my parents were poor at that time.

2.     elementary school years (no grade changes)

I tried to blend in with my friends more but still couldn't escape that feeling, so in addition to knowing the names of a few friends in class, I just sat quietly in my seat, went home after class and lied to my parents that I had a lot of friends. However, in elementary school, I showed excellent talent in almost every subject, especially math with a number of city tournaments. My parents saw that so they invested in me to learn chess and karate. Since then I have been very passionate about karate but have not had a chance to practice because my parents at home saw me not practicing so they did not give me money. When I was in elementary school, around me I thought everyone around me was worse than me, there was only one person I felt was on par (from then until the end of high school, I felt like he was as good at studying as me). I look at myself and know that this is a superior mindset, a frog at the bottom of a well, but I have no way to get out of that mindset. I see that I can only be that good and can't be any better. But that time was the first time I felt like I had friends, because they came to me to play, asked me for lessons, invited me to play soccer, or go out. Back then, I used to tease girls a lot, I didn't know what being shy was. Overall, it was a good time for me.

3.     middle school years

I have had more friends, some of my friends are still my best friends, some of them have become the most scum, scum, and uneducated bastards I've ever met. At that time, I was much worse at studying, from someone who thought he was outstanding, now I see myself as mediocre. I started to really put effort and enthusiasm into studying a certain subject well, but there wasn't really any subject I was very good at, so I couldn't prepare for the exam to get into the city's specialized school, but in return my 3 math and English subjects scored well so I was able to get into a good school. Middle school was also the first time I wanted to be 44, because the pressure from my parents had high expectations for me, and all around me were bad, dirty friends. I can't rely on anything. From then until now, every day I wonder ""why am I alive?"" and often I shock my spirit: ""to find more beautiful realities, to find happiness, to defend what I love."" I'm grateful for what my parents did for me, trained me. At that time, I hated my parents because they forced me to study too much, often cursed for a long time (a meal would definitely curse), reminded me too much of my sacrifices, or when I had bad grades, they gave me crowbars or threatened divorce?!,... oh so many. Because I know hate is not right, so one time I talked to my mother, the content was roughly like this:

\-Mom, do you feel hurt or sad when you hit and curse me so much? Do you enjoy it every time you do that?

\-I never, I never wanted to do that, but because you are too stubborn and refuse to learn or listen to your parents, we think that's the only way to do it. Parents also work very hard, and when they come home they feel pressured because they have to raise the children, so many expenses fall on the mother's head. Why don't you ask the opposite question? If you suffer, then the mother suffers many times more than you?

\-So mom still intends to teach me and me by hitting and cursing us like that? we are in so much pain

\-yeah, I have no other choice.

4. level 3 + thinking up to now

From then on, I understood that living with my mother or father, I was not compatible, they would never be completely satisfied and my thinking would never be able to innovate or become brighter, if I stayed there. In high school, I was determined to try harder to be able to ""run away"", the destination was Hanoi. I have found many good and talented friends, and sometimes I feel proud that I have them","Em không biết nên phát triển hoặc phải làm gì Xin chào mọi người, em (Nam, thẳng) năm nay 18 tuổi, 2k6 và em xin kể lại sơ lược cuộc sống của mình cho đến bây giờ. Bài viết sẽ dài, giống với tự truyện nhưng đây là lần đầu em dùng Reddit nên lời văn có thể lủng củng, em cũng muốn mọi người đọc hết bài để có thể góp ý cho em rằng em nên làm gì tiếp theo, cảm ơn mọi người nhiều ạ.

1.      Thuở mầm non

Em đang thường được bố mẹ đẩy ra ngoài xóm chơi nhưng em rất ngại và em không thể đi chơi với các bạn như bình thường vì mỗi khi đi chơi, em thường cảm thấy rất khó chịu, em ngại tiếp xúc với người khác, đặc biệt là nhiều người ( không vì lý do gì và các bạn đều thân thiện) nên em thường ở nhà và bố mẹ em hay phàn nàn về điều đó. Em cũng không thể ăn được gì quá nhiều, bất cứ đồ ăn gì em đều không nuốt được và nôn ra ngay sau đó-&gt;em bị suy dinh dưỡng. Lúc đấy bố mẹ cũng hay đánh em nhưng những trận đòn đó vẫn còn ám ảnh em đến tận bây giờ, nhưng em vẫn thông cảm vì bố mẹ em khi ấy còn nghèo khó.

2.      Những năm tiểu học (không có chuyển lớp)

Em cố gắng để hoà nhập với các bạn hơn nhưng vẫn không thể thoát khỏi cảm giác ấy, nên ngoài việc biết tên một vài bạn trong lớp ra thì em chỉ ngồi yên ở chỗ của mình, hết buổi thì đi về và nói dối bố mẹ là con có nhiều bạn lắm. Có điều cấp 1 em lại bộc lộ năng khiếu xuất sắc ở hầu hết mọi môn, nhất là toán với 1 số giải thành phố, bố mẹ em thấy điều đó nên đầu tư cho em học thêm cờ vua và Karate, từ đó em rất đam mê Karate nhưng chưa có cơ hội tập vì bố mẹ em ở nhà thấy em ko tập nên ko cho tiền. Hồi tiểu học, xung quanh em thì em nghĩ là các bạn đều kém hơn mình, duy nhất chỉ có một bạn là em thấy ngang tầm (bạn ấy từ đó đến hết cấp 3 em thấy bạn học giỏi bằng em thật). Em tự nhìn lại mình và biết đó là suy nghĩ thượng đẳng, ếch ngồi đáy giếng nhưng e không có cách nào để thoát ra khỏi cái suy nghĩ đó được, em thấy mình chỉ giỏi được đến thế mà không thể hơn được nữa. Nhưng khoảng thời gian đó là lần đầu tiên em cảm thấy mình có bạn, vì các bạn tìm đến em chơi, hỏi bài em, rủ em đi đá bóng, đi chơi. Hồi đấy em còn hay trêu các bạn nữ lắm, chả biết nhát gái là gì. Nói chung với em đó là quãng thời gian đẹp rồi.

3.      Những năm cấp 2

Em đã có nhiều bạn hơn, có những người bạn cho đến bây giờ thì vẫn là an hem chí cốt, có những đứa thì trở thành thứ chó đẻ, cặn bã, mất dạy nhất mà em từng gặp cho đến bây giờ. Khi ấy em học kém đi nhiều rồi, từ một kẻ mà cứ nghĩ là mình xuất chúng, giờ em thấy mình thật tầm thường. Em bắt đầu thực sự dành công sức và tâm huyết để học giỏi một môn nào đó, nhưng không thực sự có môn nào em quá giỏi cả, vì vậy nên em không thể ôn thi được vào trường chuyên của thành phố, nhưng bù lại 3 môn toán văn anh của em điểm ổn nên em cũng đỗ được vào trường ổn. Cấp 2 cũng là lần đầu tiên em muốn được 44, vì áp lực từ bố mẹ kỳ vọng vào em cao, xung quanh thì toàn bạn xấu, cặn bẩn. Em không thể dựa được vào đâu cả. Từ đó cho đến bây giờ, ngày nào em cũng tự hỏi là “Tại sao mình lại sống?” và thường em sốc lại tinh thần mình:”Là để tìm thấy những hiện thực tươi đẹp hơn, để đi tìm hạnh phúc, để bảo vệ những gì mình yêu thương.” Em biết ơn những gì bố mẹ em đã làm cho em, rèn luyện em, khi ấy em đã thù ghét bố mẹ vì họ bắt em học quá nhiều, thường xuyên chửi rủa trong thời gian dài (một bữa ăn chắc chắn sẽ chửi), nhắc lại quá nhiều sự hy sinh của mình, hoặc khi em điểm kém thì cho ăn xà beng hoặc đe doạ ly hôn?!,… à nhiều lắm. Vì em biết thù ghét là không nên, vì vậy có 1 lần em nói chuyện với mẹ, nội dung đại khái như này:

\-Mẹ ơi, mẹ đánh chửi con nhiều thế mẹ có đau hay buồn không? Mẹ có thích thú mỗi khi làm thế không?

\-Mẹ không hề, không bao giờ mẹ muốn làm thế, nhưng vì con quá lỳ lợm, không chịu học hỏi hay nghe lời bố mẹ nên bố mẹ nghĩ đó là cách làm duy nhất rồi. Bố mẹ làm việc cũng rất vất vả, về nhà lại áp lực vì phải nuôi các con, bao nhiêu chi phí đổ lên đầu mẹ, sao con không đặt câu hỏi ngược lại xem con khổ thì mẹ khổ gấp nhiều lần con đi?

\-Thế mẹ vẫn định dạy con và em bằng cách đánh với chửi bọn con thế à? Bọn con đau lắm

\-Ừ, mẹ không còn cách nào khác.

4. Cấp 3 + Tư duy đến giờ

Từ đấy em hiểu rằng ở cùng với mẹ hay bố, mình ko hợp, không bao giờ họ hoàn toàn vừa lòng và tư duy em sẽ không bao giờ có thể đổi mới hay tươi sáng hơn được, nếu còn ở lại đó. Cấp 3, em quyết tâm phải cố gắng hơn nữa để có thế “chạy trốn” đi, đích đến là Hà Nội. Em đã tìm được nhiều người bạn tốt, giỏi giang, nhiều lúc em thấy hãnh diện vì mình đã có những người bạn như thế. Em biết tình yêu học trò là gì, biết các loại mối quan hệ win-win, win-lose,…, biết bán mình cho tư bản, biết đi net, trốn học, lờ đi câu chửi của bố mẹ. Em thấy những bạn, mà có lẽ sau này sẽ trở thành ông to bà lớn, họ cũng đau khổ, cũng áp lực trước tình yêu, gia cảnh, sự nghiệp giống như mình nhưng họ khác bọn thất bại, cặn bã kia ở chỗ họ coi đó là lẽ đương nhiên của sự trưởng thành. Những người bạn, anh chị ấy đã đi qua những điều tiêu cực nhất nhưng họ chấp nhận nó, tiến bộ qua từng ngày. Em giờ đã không còn quá ghen tị với thành công của các bạn, mà mỗi khi thấy các bạn như thế, em học hỏi, lấy đó làm động lực để tập trung vào mục tiêu của mình. Có lẽ em cũng như vậy, hoặc luôn mong muốn trở nên như vậy. Là một người đàn ông, em không thế trông mong vào người khác, không ai cứu được mình cả, không có đứa nào nghe những gì mình tâm sự cả, may lắm thì trên reddit này bạn đọc thấy em và góp ý cho em thôi. Hạnh phúc là thứ không tự nhiên có được, ta phải tự tìm và dành lấy nó.

4.      Kết luận

Giờ đã lên được Hà Nội, đã vào được đại học ổn, em còn muốn được đi nhiều nơi hơn, đi được xa hơn, kiếm được nhiều tiền hơn nữa, em cũng rất muốn có người yêu, để dạy cho mình cách để yêu thương, để có mục đích sống, để có thể che chở bảo vệ, âu yếm, ôm ấp, trêu chọc, cùng đi trên đường, đi trên xe, cùng học tập, làm việc, để trở thành bậc bố mẹ để thay đổi những gì mà bố mẹ em đã đầu độc em. Muốn thế thôi, chứ em chưa biết làm sao để đạt được những điều đó. Em còn không chắc hiện tại tâm lý mình có ổn không, vì em rất chậm hiểu, khó tập trung. Hiện tại là sinh viên năm nhất nhưng em vẫn chưa có gì quá nhiều để định hướng phát triển, lên kế hoạch cho tương lai. Hy vọng mọi người đọc xong hãy để lại cho em góp ý, nhận xét về trải nghiệm của em. Nếu có ai thấy có gì không ổn về em, hãy cứ viết để em có thế cải thiện ạ.

Cảm ơn bạn đọc nhiều ạ.

Even though I love my parents very much, every time I go home or call to confide in them, just talking for 10 minutes makes me feel like I run out of energy.

For example: will you let me come up to your house today, Mom? Instead of answering yes or no, my mother replied: ""He went up to play for a bit and then came back. This lady is so close to her that no one wants to play alone."" then enough negative statements.

There were times when I gave my opinion as gently as possible, but my mother reacted like: that's everyone's opinion, it can't be changed. Or even saying that, my mother also said that it is the number of people who make a decision and cannot change their decision.

Or even when things happen to him in the house, my mother will often use excuses to blame like: ""Just pay attention, in everyone's family there is one person who is smart and talented, and another person who is worse. If you are as smart as your brother, then he must be less smart :)"" I have explained whether he is smart or not, that is for each person to decide, they must change their thinking, they must collide, they must have a learning mindset, then they can change, rather than blaming fate forever. This life cannot be changed. But my mother insisted on keeping that point :))

and there's a lot more to do. I really don't know how to end this situation. I love my parents very much, but every time I call or come home, I feel negative and lose all my energy. But if I don't do it, I'll see posts on Facebook like: ""new style of filial piety""... I also feel thinking.","Cảm thấy mệt mỏi khi nói chuyện với gia đình Em 23 tuổi, mới ra trường được 1 năm và đi làm thôi. Nhưng thật sự không hiểu sao em rất sợ khi gọi điện về nói chuyện với gia đình, mỗi khi có dịp nghỉ em cũng rất hạn chế về quê.

Mặc dù rất thương bố mẹ nhưng thật sự mỗi lần về quê hay gọi điện tâm sự, chỉ cần nói chuyện 10 phút là em như cạn kiệt năng lượng.

Ví dụ: Hôm nay chị có cho cháu lên nhà không thế mẹ? Thay vì trả lời là có hoặc không thì mẹ em trả lời: ""Nó lên chơi 1 tí rồi về, bà này thân cô thế cô 1 mình có ai thèm chơi đâu"". Rồi đủ các câu nói tiêu cực.

Có lúc em đã góp ý nhẹ nhàng hết mức có thể rồi, nhưng mẹ em phản ứng kiểu: đấy là cái suy nghĩ của mỗi người rồi, không thể nào mà thay đổi được. Hay kể cả bảo 1 cái đó, mẹ em cũng bảo đó là số người quyết định rồi không thể nào quyết định thay đổi được.

Hay kể cả việc anh xảy ra trong nhà, mẹ em sẽ thường lấy lý do để đổ lỗi kiểu: ""M cứ để ý mà xem, trong nhà ai cũng có 1 người thông minh, tài giỏi, còn 1 người thì kém hơn. Mày thông minh hết phần của anh mày rồi thì nó phải kém thông minh đi :)"" em đã giải thích là thông minh hay không, đó là do mỗi người quyết định, phải thay đổi tư duy phải va chạm, phải có suy nghĩ học hỏi thì nó mới có thể thay đổi, chứ đổ do số mãi thì cả đời này cũng khôgn thể thay đổi được. Nhưng mẹ em nhất quyết vẫn giữ uqan điểm đó :))

Và còn rất nhiều việc nữa. Thật sự em không biết cách nào để chấm dứt tình trạng này. Rất thương bố mẹ nhưng mỗi lần gọi về, về nhà là cảm thấy tiêu cực, mất hết năng lượng. Nhưng không làm thì lên facebook lại thấy mấy bài kiểu: ""bất hiếu kiểu mới"",.. Cũng cảm thấy suy nghĩ.","i feel tire when talk my family . i'm 23 year old , just graduate 1 year ago just start work . i really don't understand why i'm scar call home talk my family . whenever i have a break , i rarely go home . even though i love my parent very much , every time i go home call confide them , just talk 10 minute make me feel like i run out energy . example : will you let me come up your house today , mom ? instead answer yes no , my mother reply : "" he go up play a bit then come back . lady close her no one want play alone ."" then enough negative statement . there time when i give my opinion gently a possible , my mother react like : that's everyone's opinion , can't change . even say , my mother also say number people who make a decision cannot change their decision . even when thing happen him house , my mother will often use excuse blame like : "" just pay attention , everyone's family there one person who smart talented , another person who bad . if you smart a your brother , then he must less smart :)"" i have explain whether he smart not , each person decide , they must change their thinking , they must collide , they must have a learning mindset , then they can change , rather than blame fate forever . life cannot change . my mother insist keep point :)) there's a lot more do . i really don't know how end situation . i love my parent very much , every time i call come home , i feel negative lose all my energy . if i don't do , i'll see post facebook like : "" new style filial piety ""... i also feel think .",Depression

1pm9b3h,1765701414.0,2025-12-14 08:36:54,"100% FPT Scholarship Hello everyone, today I would like to tell this story
The story is that during a tutoring session, she introduced me to the 100% FPT scholarship. 
The next day at school, I asked the vice principal about this scholarship. The teacher said he gave it to another friend. When I wondered why someone had already received it, he said he had notified the whole school more than a month ago, made an announcement during the flag raising session and also sent announcements to the class. but I don't know anything (I'm the class president).
I never heard the announcement, the homeroom teacher never announced it in front of the class, and there was no announcement in class at all.
Because I go to class and then I go back to class
When I got home, I asked other classmates, but none of them knew about this scholarship (I was skeptical at this point).
The next afternoon, the teacher suddenly called me, he said that he gave this scholarship to friend x, he gave it to you because you worked a lot with the group.
I don't think it's reasonable at all, just because of the group's many activities, it's given such priority. while considering other aspects such as average score (first 3 years in the class, average gpa in the first 3 years of the grade, you are not in the top 30 of the grade, awards in school and province level competitions, I have it but you don't have it). You don't deserve anything, I think if it's not me then there are people with more difficulties who deserve it, not you. Many people were also interested in that scholarship, but when they asked the vice principal, they were shocked.
Some students even cried when they heard that the scholarship was awarded in such an opaque way (the teacher arbitrarily awarded it without any meetings). 
After that, I contacted the principal and he told me that he had received the scholarship information, but he was busy working on his master's thesis and didn't have time to implement it, so he gave it to the delegation. but the group didn't deploy and the recipient was friend x. So in the end, by giving priority to being a member of the group, you were accepted and the others were not considered. I and many other friends were very upset, but it was too late. Your scholarship application has been sent by the vice principal and you received the scholarship. You were very happy about this. Your father went to show it off to some parents, but you and other friends were disappointed with the school and the ethics of the teacher (who has an important position). This is also a lesson for me and other friends. Thank you everyone for taking the trouble to read it all!
I wonder how everyone feels about this!","Học bổng FPT 100% Xin chào mọi người, hôm nay em xin phép được kể câu chuyện này
Chuyện là vào một buổi học thêm nọ mình được cô giới thiệu cho về cái học bổng FPT 100%. 
Hôm sau lên trường em có hỏi thầy hiệu phó về học bổng này. Thầy nói đã cho một bạn khác. Khi mình thắc mắc là tại sao đã có người nhận rồi thì thầy nói thầy đã thông báo cho cả trường hơn 1 tháng rồi, có thông báo vào buổi chào cờ và đưa thông báo về lớp nữa. Nhưng mình không hề biết gì hết (mình là lớp trưởng).
Mình không nghe được thông báo lúc nào hết, giáo viên chủ nhiệm cũng chưa từng thông báo trước lớp, công không có giấy thông báo nào ở lớp cả.
Vì là vào lớp rồi mình quay lại lớp
Lúc về đến nhà mình có hỏi các bạn lớp khác thì cũng không bạn nào biết về học bổng này (lúc này mình ngờ ngợ rồi)
Xong chiều hôm sau, tự nhiên thầy gọi cho mình, thầy nói rằng cái học bổng này thầy cho bạn X rồi, thầy cho bạn vì bạn hoạt động bên đoàn nhiều.
Em thấy không hợp lý xíu nào, chỉ vì hoạt động bên đoàn nhiều mà được ưu tiên như vậy. Trong khi xét các khía cạnh khác như điểm trung bình (3 năm nhất lớp, gpa trung bình 3 năm nhất khối, bạn còn không trong top 30 khối, giải thưởng các cuộc thi cấp trường, tỉnh em có còn bạn thì không có). Bạn chẳng có gì đáng được nhận, em thấy nếu không phải em thì có những bạn khó khăn hơn đáng được nhận chứ không phải bạn. Rất nhiều bạn cũng quan tâm học bổng đó nhưng khi hỏi thầy hiệu phó thì shock.
Có bạn còn khóc khi nghe tin học bổng được trao một cách không minh bạch như vậy (thầy tự ý trao mà không có bất cứ cuộc họp nào). 
Sau đó em liên hệ với thầy hiệu trưởng, thầy có nói lại với em là thầy có nhận được thông tin học bổng nhưng thầy bận làm luận án thạc sĩ không có thời gian triển khai nên giao cho bên Đoàn. Nhưng bên Đoàn không triển khai mà người nhận là bạn X luôn. Vậy cuối cùng bằng lý do ưu tiên làm người bên đoàn thì bạn được nhận học hổng còn những người khác thì chưa được xem xét. Em cùng rất nhiều bạn khác rất bức xúc, nhưng đã muộn. Hồ sơ nhận học bổng của bạn đã được thầy hiệu phó gửi đi và bạn nhận được học bổng. Bạn rất vui vì điều này, ba bạn có đi khoe với một số phụ huynh, còn em và các bạn khác thì thất vọng về trường, đạo đức của giáo viên (người có chức vụ quan trọng). Đây cũng là một bài học cho em và các bạn khác. Cảm ơn mọi người đã chịu khó đọc hết!

First of all, I'm posting to seek advice and direction when returning home, so I hope you will give me your sincere feedback.

A little about myself: I'm male, 29 years old. To be honest, I haven't been good at studying since I was little, and I haven't had much social contact, so my communication skills are quite poor. I lack life experience and stance because from childhood until adulthood, everything I do is decided by my family, and the same is true when I study abroad. I'm introverted and don't like to ask for help, but whenever others ask, I always nod to help. I can say I am a people pleaser.

I studied abroad for more than 6 years, studying comp sci (cs), during those 6 years I switched from mech engineer to cs because I found the math subjects too difficult. When I transferred to CS, I decided to finish my studies and graduated and was about to receive my degree, but during that time I didn't do an internship so I had no experience and my GPA was also low. You can pretend you don't know anything. I decided that after getting my degree, I would return to Vietnam, find an entry-level job to do and then slowly move up, but after reading a few articles, I saw that ace it in Vietnam is unemployed, the IT industry is saturated. I have a cousin who used to work in the cloud and he also guided me to follow the cloud, saying it's easier to learn and easier to get a job than being a developer, but I should also know a little coding, so I started to get acquainted with python, I'm only at the basics, haven't been able to build anything myself yet.

Because my teacher is quite good because I have been in contact with him since I was young, in addition to the above, I am also thinking about some side jobs such as teaching, interpreter, translation, tour guide to use as a part-time job. Besides that, I also have some experience with Photoshop because I once dabbled in all kinds of manips, so I have some knowledge about graphic design.

1. What do you think about cloud jobs in Vietnam, should you follow them?
2. If you don't follow the cloud, what should you learn to do in the IT field (cyber, networking, support, ...)?
3. If I do the wrong job, what job should I do to develop?

Mình hướng nội, ko thích nhờ vả, nhưng lúc nào người khác nhờ cũng gật đầu giúp. Có thể nói mình là 1 people pleaser.

Mình du học cũng hơn 6 năm, học ngành Comp Sci (CS), trong 6 năm đó mình chuyển từ Mech Engineer sang CS do thấy mấy môn toán khó quá. Khi chuyển qua CS thì mình quyết định học cho xong và đã tốt nghiệp và sắp lãnh bằng, nhưng trong thời gian đó mình ko đi thực tập nên ko có kinh nghiệm và GPA cũng thấp. Có thể coi như là ko biết gì. Mình quyết định sau khi lấy bằng thì quay về VN, tìm 1 việc IT entry-level nào đó để làm rồi từ từ lên, nhưng đọc mấy bài thì thấy ace IT bên VN đang thất nghiệp, ngành IT thì đang bão hòa. Mình có thằng em họ từng làm cloud và nó cũng định hướng mình đi theo cloud, bảo là dễ học và cũng dễ xin việc hơn là làm dev, nhưng cũng nên biết tí coding, nên mình bắt đầu làm quen với python, đang ở mấy bài căn bản thôi, chưa tự build dc gì cả.

Vì TA mình cũng khá tốt do mình có tiếp xúc với TA từ nhỏ, nên ngoài những việc trên, mình cũng đang suy nghĩ về mấy job ngoài lề như dạy TA, thông dịch viên, dịch thuật, tour guide để dùng làm part time. Bên cạnh đó thì mình cũng có chút kinh nghiệm về photoshop vì có 1 thời từng vọc vạch manip đủ kiểu, nên có chút gì đó kiến thức về graphic design.

1. Mng nghĩ thế nào về cloud job ở VN, có nên theo ko?
2. Nếu ko theo cloud thì nên học làm gì trong mảng IT (cyber, networking, support, ...)?
3. Nếu làm trái nghề thì nên làm nghề gì để phát triển dc?

In terms of studying, I have a good GPA, in terms of personality, I'm funny, I often pay attention to the other person's feelings in my words, talking to me makes them feel comfortable, in terms of appearance, I'm under 6 inches tall, not skinny but pleasing to the eye. I love, am always grateful for everything around me, family oriented, caring, caring and like cooking. When free, I often spend time going out with friends to explore restaurants, cafes or sports activities. I don't have bad habits, if I'm sad I'll spend a little more. But I don't understand why I still don't have someone to love me back. People looking at me will think that someone like me doesn't look single. It's been almost 2 years since we broke up, my ex-lover already has someone new, but I'm still having a hard time, joking around a lot and sometimes people don't know and think I'm still in love, so I haven't moved on. I have tried very hard, I have never had a bad view of love, I always positively welcome it. But God doesn't always send anything, the people I like don't like me, the people who like me have something wrong with them. Is it so difficult to want the right person? When I meet someone I like, they treat me poorly, making me cry. Loving someone who likes you is great, but it would be even better if that person is also the person you like, and have a strong feeling of wanting to stick with and take care of them.","Làm thế nào để cải thiện tình duyên? Mình là nữ, tự đánh giá theo một cách khiêm tốn thì mình thấy mình ổn, mọi người có khen mình nhưng mình cũng hay ngại nhận. Về học tập mình GPA loại giỏi, về tính cách thì hài hước, thường để ý đến cảm xúc của đối phương trong lời nói, nói chuyện với mình khiến họ cảm thấy dễ chịu, về ngoại hình thì dưới m6 không gầy nhưng vừa mắt. Mình yêu thương, luôn biết ơn mọi thứ xung quanh, hướng về gia đình, quan tâm, chăm sóc và thích nấu nướng. Khi rảnh thường sẽ dành thời gian ra ngoài cùng bạn bè khám phá các quán ăn, quán cf hoặc hoạt động thể thao. Mình không có thói xấu, nếu buồn mình sẽ chi tiêu nhiều hơn một chút. Nhưng không hiểu sao mãi mình vẫn chưa có người yêu lại. Mọi người nhìn vào sẽ nghĩ người như mình trong không giống độc thân. Chia tay gần 2 năm, người yêu cũ cũng đã có người mới mà mình vẫn lận đận quá, nói vui vui nhiều khi người ta không biết lại tưởng mình còn luỵ nên mới chưa bước tiếp. Mình đã rất cố gắng, mình chưa bao giờ có cái nhìn xấu về tình yêu, mình lúc nào cũng tích cực chào đón nó đến. Nhưng mà ông trời toàn gửi đến gì đâu ý, người mình thích thì không thích mình, người thích mình thì lại có điểm không ổn. Muốn một người phù hợp khó vậy sao? Khi gặp được người mình thích thì họ lại đối xử với mình không ra gì làm mình khóc lên khóc xuống. Yêu người thích mình thì sướng thật đấy nhưng sẽ tuyệt hơn nếu người đấy cũng là người mình thích, có cảm giác mãnh liệt muốn gắn bó và chăm sóc họ.","how improve love ? i'm a woman , when i humbly evaluate myself , i think i'm okay . people compliment me , i'm often afraid accept . term study , i have a good gpa , term personality , i'm funny , i often pay attention other person's feeling my word , talk me make them feel comfortable , term appearance , i'm under 6 inch tall , not skinny please eye . i love , always grateful everything around me , family orient , care , care like cook . when free , i often spend time go out friend explore restaurant , cafe sport activity . i don't have bad habit , if i'm sad i'll spend a little more . i don't understand why i still don't have someone love me back . people look me will think someone like me doesn't look single . it's almost 2 year since we break up , my ex - lover already have someone new , i'm still have a hard time , joke around a lot sometimes people don't know think i'm still love , i haven't move . i have try very hard , i have never have a bad view love , i always positively welcome . god doesn't always send anything , people i like don't like me , people who like me have something wrong them . difficult want right person ? when i meet someone i like , they treat me poorly , make me cry . love someone who like you great , would even good if person also person you like , have a strong feeling want stick take care them .",Depression

Although I know it's quite late, if you want to go abroad, you have to plan from the beginning of the first year or earlier, but there are still 2.5 years left, neither long nor short, enough to learn a new language.

I want to ask how people have successfully gone abroad and settled? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions? expense? foreign language? education? cv? work experience?

The immediate priority is that I want to take advantage of the advantages I mentioned above, being able to take advantage of my IT degree, and my current English level, although not much.

Otherwise, exporting labor or studying abroad is fine

I applied for the exchange program in Singapore and passed. The acceptance deadline is approaching, but I'm still wondering about the following two directions:  
1. Stay in school as a student (because I'm a 4th year so this is my last chance) and graduate on time.  
I feel like I want to try research because I can learn many things and it will also benefit me in the future. My gpa is more than 3.9 so if I graduate on time I will be in the top 3.  
2. go to nie-ntu (sing) to exchange for 1 semester and graduate late. It's called an exchange, but I've already taken all the modules at the SP school, only the internship module remains. That means going is just for the experience, not for exchanging points or anything.  
If I go on exchange, I will graduate late and will not get my diploma until January of next year. Schools that recruit teachers usually recruit at the beginning of the year (August-September).

But if you don't go, you won't have a chance to go again. Because my family is not well off, it is very difficult to get a full scholarship for my major.

1. Ở lại trường làm NCKH SV (vì em năm 4 nên đây là cơ hội cuối cùng) và ra trường đúng hạn.  
Em cảm thấy muốn thử sức với việc nghiên cứu vì học được nhiều thứ và cũng có lợi cho mình về sau. GPA của em hơn 3.9 nên nếu ra trường đúng hạn thì cũng \~top 3.  
2. Sang NIE-NTU (Sing) trao đổi 1 học kì và ra trường muộn. Gọi là trao đổi nhưng em cũng học hết các học phần của trường SP rồi, chỉ còn mỗi học phần thực tập thôi. Nghĩa là đi thì chỉ để trải nghiệm chứ không được đổi điểm hay gì hết.  
Nếu đi trao đổi thì em sẽ ra trường muộn và tầm tháng 1 năm sau nữa mới có bằng tốt nghiệp. Mà các trường tuyển GV thì thường tuyển vào đầu năm (Tháng 8-9).

Nhưng nếu không đi thì khó có cơ hội đi nữa. Vì gia đình em không khá giả gì, mà xin học bổng Ths toàn phần ngành em thì rất khó ạ.

I'm a student majoring in French language. At that time, I came here because of low test scores. I tried to study because at that time there was no other choice and then received 2 scholarships (I swear I'm not a resident of Thread City), but it still didn't change my pessimism about the major and this school: who is too strong, the school's facilities are too fake, the students are terrible because they are both not good at studying and refuse to study, syllabus is really something that people don't use anymore so they teach it.

At the beginning of last year, I didn't want to keep getting stuck in this industry and environment, so I took the high school exam again. 

I got 26 points on the exam and got into a good school, but my family doubted that I would study at the new school and wanted to keep my old school, so I considered two schools. result: the other side's first semester gpa was more than 3.8/4, and the old school side was very poor because they used up all their mana :'))). So the family is ok to rest. When I went to reserve, the school asked me to pay more than 8 million in the final payment to allow me to reserve even though I had only been studying for 5 weeks.

Now do I want to quit or should I throw away the other field to focus on a new school with a more practical field of study, and the top school really has a super quality teaching program. I also don't plan to return to study this field because self-studying and earning a delf degree outside is enough. To be fair, I only lost 10 million from my old school because I took out nearly 14 scholarships to make up for it :'","Bỏ học ĐH Mong các bác gỡ rối :(((

Em đang là sv ngành Ngôn Ngữ Pháp, hồi đó vô đây vì thi điểm thấp, cx cố gắng học vì lúc ấy chẳng còn sự lựa chọn nào khác rồi ăn 2 cái học bổng (thề em không phải cư dân Thread city), nhưng vẫn không khiến mình thay đổi được nỗi bi quan về ngành và trường này: AI quá mạnh, cơ sở trường quá dỏm, sinh viên thì tệ lậu vì vừa học không giỏi lại vừa không chịu học, syllabus thì đúng là cái gì người ta không xài nữa thì đem đi dạy

Đầu năm ngoái em không muốn mình cứ mãi bị đụt trong cái ngành và môi trường này nên thi lại THPT. 

Thi được 26 điểm, vô được trường ngon, nhưng gia đình nghi ngờ em học ở bên trường mới có ra giống cái giống đực gì không mà đòi bảo lưu trường cũ nên thế là em cân 2 trường. Kết qủa: GPA kỳ đầu bên kia được hơn 3,8/4, còn bên trường cũ thì quá là bét vì xài hết mana rồi :’))). Vậy là gia đình ok cho nghỉ. Em lên bảo lưu thì trường đòi nộp hơn 8 triệu hốt cú chót mới cho bảo lưu dù mới chỉ học có 5 tuần.

Giờ em muốn thôi hay là vứt quách cái ngành bên kia để tập trung bên trường mới với ngành học thực tiễn hơn, và trường top quả là chương trình giảng dạy siêu chất lượng. Em cũng không tính quay lại học ngành này vì tự học rồi kiếm cái bằng DELF ở ngoài cũng đủ rồi.

1e6w987,1721367432.0,2024-07-19 05:37:12,"Should I study at BK or KHTN? As the title says, I have now passed the early admission exam for KHMT of BK (HCmut) and IT computer major in KhTN (HCmus), which school should I go to? Because at first I wanted to join BK (and thought that KHMT BK only lost to APCS KHTN, not to the Khtn IT industry group) but lately I've heard a lot of people saying that KHTN is stronger (including IT industry) so I'm also wondering. 

After looking around online and asking a few acquaintances, I came up with this (if there are any mistakes, please point them out):
1. Regarding talented bachelors/engineers (cntn/kstn): I see that bk takes the exam to enter kstn class in 2nd year, while khtn is recruiting to enter cntn class from 1st year (takes the entrance score for admission) and I definitely don't have enough points to enter; About this, I like bk better. In addition, I have to study at campus district 10 (unknown when I live there), but my house is quite far away so I have to rent a room (or dormitory) (if I study in the university village, I can go back and forth) and I think it will cost a lot of money (although I still can afford it, I feel quite sorry).
2. About choosing a major/major: I like this one better because the other thing is that you have to consider admission based on GPA (if you don't have enough points, you have to get into the major you don't want).
3. In addition, I also heard that khtn is better at algorithms, as evidenced by the icpc exams (even though cx only hsgqg information from c3 type z nma, I think cx deserves recognition) and I see on the internet that companies all talk about these things. Well, a little side note, let me ask if there were any of you who had private HSGQG prizes (especially 3rd prize or higher) in your office last year.
4. About myself: I don't know where my abilities are right now (there was a time when I talked about KSTN/CNTN, sometimes I talked about being transferred to a field I didn't want because I didn't have enough points), I don't know my direction clearly (to go to work, do research, go to higher education or choose major j) and I don't have any confidence (I see myself as having a bit of a so-called logical thinking, I taught myself programming a few months ago and found that it's bad. suitable so please apply according to the industry)

In short, based on the information I gave above plus my own comments about the curriculum, learning environment, friends, and teachers, which school is better? Besides, as I see it, the GPA of some bk cx acs is not very high, is that a big disadvantage?
When I read it, I found it a bit rambling and lengthy. I'm really sorry for this because my writing style is a bit bad. Can you read it all and give me some advice? There are still more than ten days left to consider candidates but he still hasn't chosen j 😥😥😥","Nên học it ở bk hay khtn Như tiêu đề, hiện giờ e đã đỗ xét tuyển sớm khmt của bk (hcmut) và nhóm ngành máy tính cntt ở khtn (hcmus), thì e nên học trường nào v ạ? Do ban đầu e định hướng muốn vào bk (và nghĩ là khmt bk chỉ thua apcs khtn chứ k thua nhóm ngành cntt (nn cntt) khtn) nhưng dạo gần đây nghe nhiều ng bảo khtn mạnh hơn (kể cả nn cntt) nên h e cũng đang phân vân. 

Sau khi dạo quanh trên mạng, hỏi 1 vài ng quen thì e rút ra đc ntn (có gì sai sót mong mn chỉ ra):
1. Về cử nhân/kỹ sư tài năng (cntn/kstn): e thấy bk là lên năm 2 ms thi vào lớp kstn, còn khtn là tuyển lp cntn từ năm 1 (lấy điểm đầu vào để xét tuyển) và em chắc chắc không đủ điểm vào; về cái này thì e thích bk hơn. Ngoài ra kstn bk phải học ở cs q10 (khtn thì k rõ) mà nhà e ở khá xa nên phải thuê trọ (hoặc ktx) (nếu học ở làng đh thì e đi đi về về đc) và e nghĩ là sẽ tốn 1 khoản tiền (mặc dù vẫn trong khả năng chi trả nma e thấy khá xót)
2. Về chọn ngành/ chuyên ngành: cái này e lại thích bk hơn vì khtn là phải xét tuyển dựa trên gpa (nếu k đủ điểm thì phải vào ngành mình k mong muốn)
3. Ngoài ra e còn nghe nói là khtn giỏi thuật toán hơn, bằng chứng là thi mấy cái icpc (mặc dù cx toàn hsgqg tin từ c3 kiểu z nma e thấy cx đáng phải ghi nhận) và e thấy trên mạng mấy cty toàn pvan về mấy này. À ngoài lề chút xíu nma cho e hỏi năm ngoái có bn ng có giải hsgqg tin ( đặc biệt từ giải 3 trở lên) vào bk z.
4. Về bản thân e: thì hiện h e k biết khả năng mình ở đâu (nãy h có lúc e nói về kstn/cntn, có lúc nói về việc bị chuyển sang ngành k mong muốn do k đủ điểm), e cx k rõ định hướng của bản thân (đi làm, nghiên cứu, học lên cao hơn hay chọn chuyên ngành j) và e cx k có gốc tin (tự thấy mình cx có chút gọi là tư duy logic, có tự hc lập trình vài tháng trc và thấy cx hợp nên ms đki theo nghành th)

Tóm gọi lại thì dựa trên những thông tin e đưa ra ở trên cộng thêm với những nhận xét của riêng mn về chương trình học, môi trường học hành, bạn bè, thầy cô thì học trường nào ổn hơn? Với lại theo e thấy thì gpa của mấy ac bk cx k cao lắm thì đó có phải là 1 bất lợi lớn không ạ?
Nãy mn đọc có thể thấy hơi lan man và dài dòng. Cái này thực sự xin lỗi mn do cách hành văn của e hơi tệ nma có thể đọc hết và cho e vài lời khuyên đc k ạ.

1ln57lb,1751168685.0,2025-06-29 03:44:45,"I regret choosing the right direction, but the wrong industry. Hello everyone, the story is that I'm learning English and will be in 4th grade by the end of this summer. I'm struggling to find an internship. I've found one, but to get it I have to ask for a letter of recommendation from the department. Naturally, I find the procedures with the department's support a bit cumbersome, so I naturally thought back to the past that I should study pedagogy. 

At that time, I also insisted that the teaching profession was not suitable for me. I intended to teach more for fun, thinking that I was studying for freedom, not being forced to serve pedagogy and to discover myself. And now, nearing my final year, after 2 years of learning about the teaching profession and 1 year of teaching, teaching is ironically the career that suits me best and I do the best, to the point where I registered to take spa courses at school and have the intention of graduating, working for a few years and then studying for a master's degree to become a lecturer.   

As for business English or translation and interpretation, even though I study well and my GPA is really high, it doesn't suit me at all. I can't imagine myself doing business or translating. And this specialized knowledge will not help me much in my future teaching work. 

So in short, I hated the spa from the beginning, but now I'm stuck with it. It's a pity that I didn't study spa in the past. Not only did I get free tuition, a monthly allowance of 3.5 million, but I also had priority to teach in high school (in theory, it's still okay, but when they've recruited all the spas and still lack something, then it'll be my turn). 

If only I had studied spa that day, now I would have saved 100 million HP, and my parents wouldn't have had to spend nearly 200 million to raise me for 4 years. That amount of 300 million may be the capital for me to have a launching pad to study abroad for a master's degree in the future. but if only but if only. Because of a decision I made when I was young, I now have to take a detour that is a little further and more difficult. I know that even if you want to be a university teacher, you still have to study for a master's degree, but I still regret the university tuition fees and regret that I don't have many opportunities to teach in high school (at least until I finish my master's degree).

When I returned home last time, I also shared with my mother. My mother also blamed me. The other day, she implicitly told me to go to spa school, but seeing that I said I wasn't passionate about it, she didn't force me. That, combined with this internship mess, makes me regret it even more. 

  
It's over, it can't be changed now, my direction is clear, I'm just still feeling regretful so I'm pouring my heart out here, regardless of whether anyone reads it or not. If anyone reads it, thank you everyone for reading this far.   
I will continue to handle the internship.","Tiếc nuối vì chọn đúng định hướng, nhưng sai ngành. Chào các bác, chuyện là em học Ngôn Ngữ Anh, hết hè này cũng lên năm 4 rồi. Em đang chật vật với việc kiếm chỗ thực tập, em cũng tìm được một chỗ rồi nhưng để được thì phải xin Letter of Recommendation từ Khoa, tự nhiên em thấy thủ tục rườm rà với Support của Khoa hơi ba chấm nên cái tự nhiên nghĩ lại xưa mình nên học Sư Phạm Anh cho rồi. 

Thời đó em cũng một mực khăng khăng nghề dạy không hợp với em, định dạy thêm cho vui là cùng, nghĩ là học NNA để tự do, không bị ràng buộc phải phục vụ sư phạm và để khám phá bản thân. Để rồi đến bây giờ, gần lên năm cuối, sau 2 năm tìm hiểu về nghề dạy và 1 năm đi dạy thì nghề sư phạm lại trớ trêu thay là nghề hợp với em nhất và em làm ổn nhất, đến mức em đăng ký học cả các môn SPA trong trường và có hẳn định hướng ra trường đi làm vài năm rồi học lên Thạc Sĩ để làm Giảng Viên nữa.   

Còn Tiếng Anh Thương Mại hay Biên Phiên Dịch, dù em học tốt, GPA em cao thật đấy, lại không hợp gì em cả, em không tưởng tượng mình làm Kinh Doanh hay Dịch được. và các kiến thưc chuyên ngành này cũng không giúp được em nhiều trong công việc giảng dạy sau này. 

Thế tóm lại là từ đầu em chê SPA, rốt cục giờ cũng dính chặt với nó. Tiếc cái xưa không học SPA, vừa được miễn học phí, được trợ cấp 3.5 Triệu hàng tháng, mà còn được ưu tiên dạy Trường Phổ Thông (NNA lý thuyết vẫn được nhưng khi nào người ta tuyển hết SPA rồi mà vẫn thiếu gì mới tới lượt NNA). 

Phải chi ngày đó em học SPA thì bây giờ đã tiết liệm được 100 Triệu HP, mà ba mẹ em cũng không cần bỏ gần 200 Triệu nuôi em trong 4 Năm. Khoảng tiền 300 Triệu đó có khi lại là vốn để sau này em có bệ phóng đi du học Thạc Sĩ nữa. Ấy mà giá như cũng chỉ mà giá như. Vì quyết định thời trẻ, mà giờ em phải đi đường vòng xa hơn tí, khó hơn nữa. Biết là dù cả SPA hay NNA muốn làm GV ĐH thì vẫn phải học Thạc Sĩ, nhưng em vẫn tiếc học phí ĐH, tiếc không có nhiều cơ hội được dạy trường phổ thông (ít nhất là cho đến khi em xong Thạc Sĩ).

Đợt trước về quê em cũng chia sẻ với mẹ, mẹ em cũng trách em ngày trước mẹ ngầm ý kêu em học SPA đi, mà thấy em nói không đam mê nên cũng không ép em. Việc đó, cộng với vụ lằng nhằng Thực tập này làm em thấy tiếc lại càng tiếc hơn. 

  
Chuyện cũng đã qua rồi, giờ cũng chẳng thay đổi được, định hướng của em cũng đã rõ, chỉ là em vẫn thấy tiếc nuối nên em trải lòng lên đây, mặc kệ có ai đọc hay gì không. Nếu có ai đọc thì em cảm ơn mọi người đã đọc đến đây nhé.   
Em lại tiếp tục xử lý việc thực tập đây.

My goal is to study for a master's degree in English in Japan or Taiwan. However, my family's circumstances are relatively normal so I can't spend too much to study on my own, so I still want to go on a scholarship. I have researched a few schools in Japan such as utokyo, titech, kyushu, kyodai, and the case studies I know all have sparkling profiles, because they are top schools, they are also competitive. In addition, I was also advised by a teacher that I should contact the schools' labs first instead of applying through the DSQ, which would save time and increase my chances. 

Briefly speaking about my profile: my current gpa is not very high, about 3.2 and tends to decrease in the 3rd year because I have some psychological problems and cannot balance my studies. I like Japan, so I studied Japanese up to N3 before. Has 1 award but not high level and participates in councils and academic and cultural clubs (also in a lead position). Participated in the math institute's summer school. Currently, I'm working with a teacher to do a research project on bioinformatics, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to write a paper. My English is at the level of reading and understanding specialized documents and basic communication (mainly because I am too deaf in English), because before that I focused on learning Japanese first.

I know my profile is still weak so I plan to take a gap year after college to work while improving my profile and taking the gre exam. I expect that if I learn English from now, by next year I will be able to get ielts 6.5-7.0. Please let me know if with a profile like this I can improve further to have a chance :&lt; Before that, I was focusing on the Japanese market so I just researched Japan.

Mục tiêu của em là học lên master hệ tiếng anh tại Nhật hoặc Đài Loan, tuy nhiên hoàn cảnh nhà em tương đối bình thường nên không thể bỏ ra quá nhiều để đi diện tự túc nên em vẫn muốn đi theo diện học bổng. Em có tìm hiểu qua 1 vài trường bên Nhật như UTokyo, TiTech, Kyushu, Kyodai thì các case study em biết đều hồ sơ lung linh lấp lánh cả, vì là trường top nên cũng cạnh tranh. Ngoài ra em cũng được một thầy khuyên rằng nên liên hệ xin vào lab của các trường trước thay vì nộp qua ĐSQ thì sẽ đỡ mất thời gian và tăng cơ hội. 

Nói sơ qua về hồ sơ của em thì: GPA của em hiện tại không cao lắm, cỡ 3.2 và có xu hướng giảm ở năm 3 do em gặp chút vấn đề tâm lý và không cân bằng được việc học. Em thích Nhật Bản nên trước đó có học tiếng Nhật đến N3 rồi. Có 1 giải NCKH nhưng cấp không cao và có tham gia HĐNK và clb học thuật, văn hoá (cũng ở vị trí lead). Có tham gia trường hè của Viện Toán. Hiện tại em đang theo 1 thầy làm đề tài nghiên cứu về tin sinh, tuy nhiên em cũng không chắc chắn có được viết báo không. Tiếng anh của em đang ở mức đọc hiểu tài liệu chuyên ngành và giao tiếp cơ bản (chủ yếu là em bị điếc tiếng anh quá), do trước đó em tập trung học tiếng Nhật trước.

Em biết profile của em còn yếu nên em định gap 1 năm sau đại học vừa đi làm vừa cải thiện profile của mình và thi GRE.

My cousin is about to graduate from college and is taking an internship and he asked me to ask my dad to ask for a company he knew so he could graduate so he wouldn't have to actually do an internship. I agree. A few days later, he asked me if I could ask him to give me the wood for his friends, about 4 other children. I didn't really like this idea, but I found it so fun that I agreed. When I printed out the internship paper, I was afraid that someone would sign it and stamp it without space, so I marked the necessary places with a pencil and gave it to my father so he could give it to someone to sign. Unfortunately, the other guy and I are older, we don't know much about this and are careless. We just signed and didn't double-check, resulting in a missing file for one of our younger siblings.

When my brother found out, it was too late because this Friday was the deadline, and the person who signed the wood had gone on a business trip, and there was no way to redo it (specifically, I printed out the paper, marked it with r and told 3 of me. He took it to the other guy and gave the same instructions. The other cell did it, but missed 1 student. No one checked the 2 boxes, and sent it back to the t. I didn't check it either, gave it to me. 30 minutes later, he found out, but when he This is so late, because my father went to work and the other guy also left, he can't do the carpentry anymore). So the missing girl is forced to use an outside service, the price is 1 bulb due to urgency. My sister felt sorry for that little bank and gave her 100 extra, but she asked for half because it was my brother's fault. I found out that it was a problem because she had to work extra for more than one month's salary, the family was in difficulty, while the other child had to bear the responsibility of studying, so I helped her, but bad luck happened, so how could I get paid in advance? Besides, I do it for free, it doesn't cost me anything. Now my cousin is kind of annoyed with me, like if 5 sheets of dc moc are enough then I'll be fine. I also have a feeling that she will share 500 with that girl because she lacks friends, is sensitive, being blocked by someone even though she is not close to her, she will be very sad when angry.

From everyone's perspective, who is wrong?

small child =&gt; Why don't you go find wood yourself and ask someone else to pay for it?

1i2jj41,1737011931.0,2025-01-16 07:18:51,"Young people today often don't have the habit of planning?  
I'm a 3-year-old, my family has a child younger than 1 year old and my job also trains a few genz friends, and I realize that they don't plan anything, like everything they do is taken into account, causing many things to just jump to the last minute or waste unnecessary time.

For example, my younger brother will graduate from college this year. I told him that I had written a cv so that I could review it this time around Tet. He said why would he write it since he hasn't graduated yet (huh? If you don't prepare your cv for a job in your final year, when will you prepare it???), not to mention that he also failed to register for a course so he might not graduate on time with his peers. While a few years ago he was studying while playing. When I asked him why he had so much free time, he said he would lose all his credits if he studied slowly. Because before I studied abroad, the expenses and tuition in a foreign country were expensive so I always planned a year in advance, while my younger brother studied in Vietnam, I thought the program in another country would be more leisurely. but no, after talking for a while, I realized it was because he was working without any plan at all.

Or like the genz girls I train, every job has specific task lists and requirements. As long as they divide the work first, they will never be overwhelmed by work. Then I gave them a plan for next month's events and they were like whatever was convenient for them to do. They didn't arrange to see if the schedules were related, leading to either being deadline chasing or being super free 😐

I feel that if they just plan in advance, short-term or long-term, they will use their time much more effectively, but very few do that while in my generation, everyone of my friends has more or less a plan for work or life... why is this soft skill so few people focus on young people?

edit: no offense or hating an entire generation, the sentence in the title is also a question. Before I worked as a freelancer for a long time, now I'm working in the hospitality environment in a tourist city. The quality of young people here is probably not as good as big cities like Singapore or Hanoi. After talking to my brother, I felt a bit annoyed so I wanted to see what was going on around me.","Các bạn trẻ bây giờ thường không có thói quen lập kế hoạch?  
Mình 3x, nhà có em nhỏ hơn 1 giáp và công việc cũng training vài bạn genz, và mình nhận ra các em không lên kế hoạch gì, kiểu như việc đến đâu thì tính đến đó khiến cho nhiều việc cứ bị nước đến chân mới nhảy hoặc lãng phí thời gian không cần thiết ấy.

Ví dụ như em trai mình năm nay sẽ tốt nghiệp đại học rồi, mình bảo nó là đã viết CV để đợt này về Tết m review cho, thì nó bảo nó còn chưa tốt nghiệp thì viết làm gì (ủa? năm cuối rồi ko chuẩn bị CV xin việc thì khi nào mới chuẩn bị???), chưa kể là nó còn đăng ký hụt môn nên khả năng ko tốt nghiệp kịp với các bạn cùng lứa. Trong khi mấy năm trước nó vừa học vừa chơi, mình có hỏi sao rảnh vậy thì nó bảo học từ từ cũng hết tín chỉ. Do trước mình đi du học, chi tiêu và tiền học xứ người đắt đỏ nên lúc nào mình cũng lên kế hoạch trước cả năm, còn em mình học ở VN, mình cứ tưởng chương trình ở VN khác nên thong dong hơn. Nhưng không, nói một hồi thì mình nhận ra là do nó làm việc chả có kế hoạch gì cả thôi.

Hoặc như mấy em genz mình training mọi công việc đều có task lists và requirements cụ thể hết rồi, chỉ cần mấy ẻm chia công việc trước sẽ không bao giờ bị việc đè việc cả. Rồi mình đưa plan events tháng tới mấy ẻm cũng kiểu thấy cái nào tiện thì làm cái đấy, không sắp xếp xem schedule có dính nhau không, dẫn đến một là bị deadline dí hoặc sẽ là siêu rảnh 😐

Mình thấy chỉ cần có lập kế hoạch trước, ngắn hạn hay dài hạn thì mấy ẻm sẽ sử dụng thời gian hiệu quả hơn rất nhiều nhưng rất ít em nào làm thế trong khi thế hệ mình, bạn bè đứa nào cũng có plan ít nhiều cho công việc hoặc cuộc sống... Sao kỹ năng mềm này lại ít người chú trọng cho các bạn trẻ vậy nhỉ?

Edit: no offense hay chụp mũ cả một thế hệ, câu trên title cũng là câu hỏi thắc mắc. Trước m làm tự do khá lâu, giờ quay vào môi trường hospitality ở một thành phố du lịch. Chất lượng các bạn trẻ ở đây khả năng là không bằng những tp lớn như SG hay HN.

1orps94,1762609508.0,2025-11-08 13:45:08,"Should I change jobs at the present time i. advantages

1. Salary is okay with what I expected. (compared to new graduate students)
2. Provided with good working equipment
3. The lead guy is quite easy-going
4. Working on an agricultural project, strange knowledge I have not yet learned. They develop app products. agricultural company, but now I work little more
5. For agricultural projects, the success rate of calling for state capital is very high. At that time, they will expand the team size, then you will have a higher lead rate and better benefits.
ii. Disadvantages (reasons why you want to move)
1. Traveling quite far from home (total travel time per day is 5-6 hours by bus). I can't stay in the apartment. So going to work is quite tiring and has little time at home
2. work during probationary period (they are saying that after the project is stable, they will give more time off)
3. Team size is too small
4. Work without process and lack of professionalism.
5. I don't know the future, but after a lot of time, I see that a lead's progress is quite slow. Professionalism increased slowly
5. Many arguments often arise, but there is no specific explanation from a lead. Many of the things you mentioned, I find unreasonable. When I give feedback, I often can't explain which one to choose. but he closed it with his mouth. That is, there is no evaluation between options. This is exactly what he said and I just followed.  But then you usually won't be able to develop. Because I don't understand deeply, I don't understand clearly why.
6. Due to lack of professional process, assigning tasks, receiving tasks, and reporting are all absent. very difficult to do. and deadlines are often very urgent. Every time the lead talks, he tells me that this task only takes 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. Overall, I feel very stressed
7. When I have to work like that, I don't think it's high
8. The company culture is because the team is small, so there are very few activities such as going out, October 20 occasions... they organize it very quickly and then get back to work.
iii. The reason why Mark wants to dance
i. Wondering reason for wanting to dance
1. I'm on probation for 1 month, if I jump now it will be too soon.
2. Near Tet, the market is less difficult. I can try to go out for Tet
3. If I don't dance now, will it be easy to dance until I officially sign? (I'll only ask until Tet).
4. My graduate level is still quite young, but I am still very enthusiastic
5. IT market is very difficult now
so i'm wondering. The first is to try to finish it until Tet to see if the project is successful in raising capital. 2 is to dance before Tet. I look forward to receiving feedback from everyone. The reason I write at length is because I want people to better understand the context, so they can give me the best suggestions

Thank you everyone","Có nên nhảy việc thời điểm hiện tại I. Ưu điểm

1. Lương tạm ổn với những gì em mong đợi.(So với sinh viên mới ra trường)
2. Được cấp các thiết bị làm việc tốt
3. Anh lead khá dễ tính
4. Được làm dự án nông nghiệp, những kiến thức lạ em chưa được học. Họ phát triển app product ạ. công ty về nông nghiệp, nhưng giờ làm thêm IT
5. Dự án về nông nghiệp, tỉ lệ gọi vốn thành công nhà nước là rất cao. Lúc đó họ sẽ mở rộng team size, rồi em có tỉ lệ lên lead cao hơn, phúc lợi tốt hơn.
II. Nhược điểm (lí do khiến em muốn chuyển)
1. Di chuyển từ nhà khá xa(Tổng time di chuyển 1 ngày rơi vào 5-6h đi xe bus). Em lại ko thể ở trọ được. Nên đi làm khá mệt và ít time ở nhà
2. Làm trong time thử việc (họ đang bảo sau dự án ổn định sẽ cho nghỉ thêm)
3. Team size quá bé
4. Làm việc ko có quy trình, thiếu chuyên nghiệp.
5. Tương lai thì em ko rõ, nhưng trải qua nhiều time nhưng em thấy tốc độ tiến bộ của a lead khá chậm. Sự chuyên nghiệp tăng lên chậm
5. Thường xuyên xảy ra nhiều tranh cãi, nhưng không có giải thích cụ thể từ a lead. Nhiều cái a đưa ra, e thấy ko hợp lý. Khi e phản hồi lại a thường ko giải thích đc nên chọn cái nào. Mà a ấy chốt bằng mồm luôn. Tức là a ý ko có sự đánh giá giữa các phương án. Điều này thì về đúng là a ý đưa ra cái j e chỉ biết làm theo.  Nhưng như vậy e thường sẽ ko phát triển đc. Do ko hiểu sâu, ko hiểu rõ tại sao.
6. Do thiếu quy trình chuyên nghiệp, việc giao task, nhận task, báo cáo đều ko có. Làm rất khó khăn. Mà deadline thường rất gấp. Mỗi lần lead nói chuyện đều bảo task này a dùng cursor chỉ 5 phút 10 phút 15p. Nhìn chung em thấy rất căng thẳng
7. Lương như vậy khi phải làm t7... Thì em nghĩ lại ko hề cao
8. Văn hoá công ty do team it bé, nên rất ít có các hoạt động như đi chơi, các dịp 20/10... Họ tổ chức rất nhanh rồi lại vào làm tiếp.
III. Lý do thăc mác muốn nhảy
I. Lý do thắc mắc muốn nhảy
1. Em đang thử việc còn 1 tháng, nếu nhảy bây giờ thì sẽ sớm quá.
2. Thời điểm gần tết, thị trường it khó khăn. Em có thể cố ra tết
3. Nếu ko nhảy bây giờ, liệu đến khi ký chính thức có dễ nhảy ko (ra tết mới xin)
4. Trình độ em mới ra trường còn khá non, nhưng em vẫn rất nhiệt huyết
5. Thị trường it giờ rất khó khăn
Vì vậy e đang thắc mắc. 1 là cố làm nốt ra tết xem dự án có gọi vốn thành công ko. 2 là nhảy luôn trước tết. Em rất mong nhận đc góp ý từ mọi người. Lý do em viết dài vì muốn mọi người hiểu rõ hơn về context, để có thể cho em những gợi ý tốt nhất

When I was still in Hanoi, I often went out and warmed up our feelings. Now that I've been home for almost 2 months, I only text and occasionally video call. In general, contact is still regular.
Lately, I've been arguing a lot because my friend has 2 jobs and many deadlines, so she works all day long, until 2am. I also sympathize with you but sometimes I feel sorry for myself. She said that now we should reduce the frequency of small talk by texting every day, and she should worry about making money and saving money so that when I go back to the city, we can go out and travel together to warm up later. 
I think it's reasonable, but in my heart it's still like that. It won't be until the middle of next year that I decide to move back to the city. There's no chance of meeting each other, the frequency of texting has decreased, I don't know what will happen.
I know that the people here are mostly male and they are seniors and have experience. Can you please tell me what I need to do to make her more comfortable, less pressured, and to keep our relationship from being damaged? My personality is the type that easily feels sorry for myself, or ovtk, but I can fix it, but I don't know what to say to soothe her, make her happy after stressful work hours, and most of all, have quality conversations via text message in the short amount of time at the end of the day.
Thank you so much everyone🥰","Con trai yêu xa cần gì? Em là nữ 22t. Ra trường thì e về quê gap year ôn thi để học lên, ny em bằng tuổi ở lại HN để đi làm. Hồi còn ở HN còn hay đi chơi rồi hâm nóng tình cảm này kia. Bây giờ về nhà đc gần 2 tháng thì chỉ nhắn tin, thi thoảng video call. Nói chung liên lạc vẫn đều đặn.
Gần đây có cãi cọ khá nhiều vì bạn ny em làm 2 job, nhiều deadline nên thời gian làm kín cả ngày, đến tận 2h sáng. E cũng thông cảm cho bạn nhưng nhiều khi thấy tủi thân. Bạn ấy bảo giờ nên giảm tần suất nói chuyện phiếm bằng cách nhắn tin hàng ngày đi, còn bạn ấy lo kiếm tiền rồi tiết kiệm tiền để bao giờ em lên lại thành phố rồi cùng đi chơi, đi du lịch với nhau hâm nóng sau. 
Em thấy cũng hợp lý nhưng trong lòng cứ thế nào ấy ạ. Phải tầm giữa năm sau em mới quyết định về việc lên lại thành phố. Gặp nhau đã không có cơ hội, tần suất nhắn tin còn giảm, k biết sẽ thế nào.
Em biết mn ở đây chủ yếu là nam và là các anh đi trước, có kinh nghiệm. Mn cho em hỏi em cần làm gì để bạn ấy thoải mái hơn, bớt áp lực hơn và mối quan hệ của bọn em k sứt mẻ đc ạ. Tính tình của em là kiểu dễ tủi thân, hay ovtk nhưng em có thể sửa được, có điều em k biết nên nói ntn để làm dịu bạn ấy, làm bạn ấy vui sau giờ làm việc căng thẳng, và hơn cả là có những cuộc trò chuyện chất lượng qua tin nhắn với quỹ thời gian cuối ngày ngắn ngủi.

story background:

* I'm an iter working on my final year thesis, the deadline is approaching (\~ 1 month). I'm dating a girl of the same age who studies pedagogy. The two of us have known each other for a long time from high school to college. You finish and wait for graduation
* After graduation, you plan to move closer to home (Bmt Daklak), relatives are all public school teachers, you also have many reasons to return such as having someone to take care of work, being close to your parents, you want to stay home to take care of your dad for health reasons, you are afraid of being alone outside Singapore, etc...
* I'm an iter and see that the BMT market for IT is not very positive, working remotely doesn't have many advancement opportunities. I'm working in SG and feel it's suitable. So I will stick with sg for a long time. 

We also talked clearly, you said you would wait for me for a long time, up to a few years if I agreed to come back to BMT. But I feel so no hope. I'm so sad that I can't concentrate while working/doing my thesis, and I can't eat or sleep well either 🤒

Please share honestly, otherwise I just want to write it down to ease my pain 🥲

Wishing you good health! thanks!","Tâm sự chuyện tình yêu... xa... Hi các bác, tình hình là em đang khá sầu mấy hôm nay

Background câu chuyện:

* Em là ITer đang làm khóa luận năm cuối, sắp tới deadline rồi (\~ 1 tháng). Đang quen 1 bạn nữ cùng tuổi học sư phạm Anh. 2 đứa quen nhau khá lâu từ cấp 3 đến đại học. Bạn thì xong xuôi rồi đợi tốt nghiệp
* Sau tốt nghiệp bạn dự định về gần nhà (BMT Đaklak), họ hàng đều làm giáo viên trường công, bạn thì cũng có nhiều lí do để về như là có ng lo công việc, gần ba mẹ, bạn muốn ở nhà trông ba vì lí do sức khỏe, bạn sợ ở ngoài SG chỉ có 1 mình etc...
* Em thì ITer thấy thị trường BMT về IT không mấy khả quan, làm remote thì cơ hội thăng tiến không nhiều. Đang đi làm ở SG và cảm thấy cũng phù hợp. Nên em sẽ stick với SG lâu dài. 

Bọn em thì cũng có nói chuyện rõ ràng cả rồi, bạn ngỏ ý sẽ chờ em được lâu dài, tận vài năm nếu em đồng ý về BMT. Nhưng em thấy no hope quá. sầu mà làm việc/làm khóa luận không tập trung được, ăn ngủ nghỉ  cũng không ngon luôn 🤒

The thing is, I feel like my dad is looking at me as a long-term investment. My father often told me that he had worked hard to raise a family, but he also paid filial piety. Along with that, I'm over 20 years old and I'm often supervised (when I intend to install a cam in my room or ask the landlord to access the cam), and I'm looked down upon by my father. Every time there is an argument, my father often affirms that he is always right, even if he is wrong, because he is my father, he is always right. In the end, it's just for the good. In addition, my father often forbade me to play music or play games. So now I don't have many friends in the IT industry, probably no one doesn't play games. My father's goal is for me to only study in school and then go home to continue studying. Then he often boasted that he was the son of this man, a relative, and had an internship with a salary of 7-8 digits, then asked me to try to do the same. Recently, I asked my father for some money to install a computer to both study and play light games, mainly talking to friends who listened to an hour-long lecture saying that building a computer can only be for playing games, investing in education is not a shame, but computers can only be games, playing games is ruining the future and then said that this guy's son plays games and now that he has graduated, he has no money to live off the family, etc. I had a lot of deadlines so I slept late with a student who didn't have enough money, so I ate noodles all the time, so I lost weight, but my dad kept saying that I stayed up late playing games so much that I was sick and looked like I had no future. In the past, because of the pressure of the university entrance exam, I scored 44 a few times, but somehow I still passed, probably because I was too cowardly and afraid of death. Lately, I feel like my life is not meaningful, and sometimes I have thoughts like 44, but I think mom and I'm sad at home, so that's it. My dad often says that you have to reflect on your own mistakes because they can only be your fault, so I think maybe there's something wrong, but I'm not sure. Sometimes when I see my friends all happily enjoying their student days, I feel a bit sad. I also know a few friends who are rich people and don't care about studying, but those are the only ones who hang out with me, but lately they've been borrowing money from me all the time so I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

Bố thường kể công đẻ ra nuôi ăn lớn sau mà còn báo hiếu. Kèm với đó là em hơn 20 rồi mà hay bị giám sát (có ý định gắn cam phòng trọ hay xin chủ trọ truy cập cam chung), với bị xem thường bởi bố em. Mỗi lần cãi nhau là bố em thường xuyên khẳng định là bố luôn đúng, dù có sai thì vì là bố nên luốn đúng. Chung quy lại cũng chỉ vì muốn tốt. Ngoài ra, bố em thường cấm cản đàn đúng hay chơi game. Thành ra bây giờ em cũng không có mấy bạn tại mấy bác trong ngành cntt chắc không ai không chơi game đâu, Bố em hướng tới là em chỉ có học trên trường rồi về nhà học tiếp. Rồi thường xuyên khoe là con ông này người quen họ hàng, ra thực tập lương 7-8 chữ số rồi kêu em cố gắng được như vậy. Đợt vừa rồi em xin bố em ít tiền để lắp cái pc vừa để học mà vừa chơi game nhẹ thôi chủ yếu nói chuyện với mấy bạn mà nghe giảng suốt 1 tiếng là lắp máy tính chỉ có thể là chơi game, đầu tư học hành thì không tiếc chứ mấy cái máy tính chỉ có thể là game, chơi game là hư cả tương lai rồi nói con ông này chơi game giờ ra trường không có tiền ăn bám gia đình, vân vân. Em chạy deadline nhiều nên ngủ muộn với sinh viên ít tiền nên toàn ăn mỳ thành ra sụt ký mà bố em cứ bảo là thức khuya chơi game cho lắm vào người ốm yếu, nhìn người trông không có tương lai. Ngày xưa, cũng vì áp lực thi đại học mà em đinh 44 vài lần rôi nhưng sau không hiểu sao vẫn vượt qua được chắc là hèn quá sợ chết. Dạo gần đây em thấy mình sống không có ý nghĩa lắm lâu lâu cũng có suy nghĩ 44 nhưng nghĩ mẹ, em ở nhà buồn nên cũng thôi. Bố em thường nói là phải biết tự kiểm điểm lỗi là chỉ có thể do mình nên em nghĩ có lẽ là sai ở đâu nhưng em cũng không rõ. Nhiều khi em thấy bạn bè ai cũng vui vẻ tận hưởng thời sinh viên cũng có hơi chạnh lòng. Em cũng có quen một vài đứa bạn nhưng lại kiểu nhà giàu hay ăn chơi không lo học nhưng mà đó là mấy đứa duy nhất hay chơi với em nhưng gần đây tụi nó mượn tiền em suốt nên em cảm thấy như bị lợi dụng.

1kiox9k,1746813498.0,2025-05-09 17:58:18,"graduate question Hello everyone, I'm male, a senior student. I don't know where to post this so I'll try posting here to hear everyone's opinions.

During my school years, I was fortunate to participate in scientific research and receive the attention of the dean. After that, I asked you to do some work for your articles. Through that process, the teacher trusted me more and offered me to come to his own clinic to learn as an apprentice, as well as create conditions for me to write my own article from the data sources he had available. However, during the writing process, the teacher gave me almost no support other than giving me deadlines and urging me to do it. When I submitted my work, he didn't bother to read it, but just told me to state the main idea and then asked me to continue. And because the teacher didn't read it, and the article was relatively complicated for my student level (I heard this comment from a senior with a master's degree), the writing process was very confusing. But in the end, I found my own way to write and completed an article but separated it into 2 articles. However, in the end, my teacher didn't even bother to check the content I wrote and just sent it for editing and published it in the newspaper. As a result, both papers were rejected. 

One thing that's a bit annoying is that even though he has a wife and children, he still tends to like boys and I was unlucky enough to be harassed during that time :) After that, I also knew and kept my distance as much as possible. The teacher interpreted it as me being lazy and dismissed him from the clinic and stopped contacting me.

I want to apply for a master's degree in the near future, but I don't have any articles to list in my cv, and I no longer have a good relationship with my teacher. So should I tell the school that I have experience writing articles? And if the school asks why I didn't contact the dean to write a letter of recommendation for me, what should I say? I'm a bit confused at this part and would like to hear everyone's opinions. Thank you!","Thắc mắc cao học Chào mọi người, em là nam, sinh viên năm cuối. Em cũng không biết đăng vào đâu hỏi cho phải nên thử đăng vào đây nghe ý kiến của mọi người.

Trong những đi học, em may mắn được tham gia nghiên cứu khoa học và đuợc thầy trưởng khoa chú ý. Sau đó thầy có nhờ em một số việc cho các bài báo của thầy. Qua quá trình đó thầy có tin tưởng em hơn và offer em về phòng khám riêng để học việc cũng như sau đó là tạo điều kiện để em viết bài báo riêng từ các nguồn data thầy có sẵn. Tuy nhiên trong quá trình viết thì hầu như thầy không hỗ trợ em gì ngoài giao deadline và hối em làm, lúc em nộp bài thì cũng không thèm đọc mà chỉ nói em nêu ý chính rồi bảo em làm tiếp. Và bởi vì thầy không hề đọc, và bài báo đó tương đối phức tạp đối với trình độ sinh viên của em (cái này em được nghe một đàn anh là thạc sĩ nhận xét như vậy), cho nên là quá trình viết rất loằng ngoằng. Nhưng sau cùng thì em cũng tự tìm ra hướng viết và hoàn thành một bài nhưng tách ra được 2 bài báo. Mặc dù vậy thì sau cùng thầy em cũng không thèm kiểm tra nội dung em viết mà chỉ gửi edit và đăng báo luôn. Kết quả là toàn bị reject cả 2 bài. 

Có một cái hơi phiền là mặc dù thầy đã có vợ con nhưng xu hướng thầy vẫn thích con trai và em không may mắn bị quấy rối trong khoảng thời gian đó :) sau đó em cũng biết và giữ khoảng cách hết mức có thể. Thầy diễn giải ra là em lười và cho nghỉ phòng khám cũng như không còn liên lạc nữa.

Sắp tới em muốn apply học thạc sĩ, tuy nhiên em không có bài báo để liệt kê trong cv, cũng như là hiện tại đã không còn mối quan hệ tốt với thầy. Vậy em có nên nói với bên trường về việc mình đã có kinh nghiệm viết báo không, và nếu trường hỏi tại sao em không liên hệ với thầy trưởng khoa làm thư giới thiệu cho em thì em nên nói ra sao ạ? Em hơi quằn đoạn này mong muốn nghe được ý kiến của mọi người.

1hcfgvg,1733986768.0,2024-12-12 06:59:28,"“If you and my computer fall into the water, who will you save first?” Last year, I was a true newbie in the profession, working in the morning and studying at night to learn more skills. My familiar image is a guy holding a laptop from morning to night. To the point, my ""lover"" - literally, not just my laptop - even gets jealous of the computer because I spend too much time on it.

At the company, I consult and discuss all kinds of things, but at home I can't handle the only ""difficult customer"" in my life. However, life is not like a dream. My laptop is obedient, serving me day and night, and my ""lover"" is becoming more and more difficult. She even bluntly declared: ""I love my laptop more than I love you, I don't care about you, I'm bored with you, I don't love you, lol..""

If we can't solve the problem, we'll solve the problem creator!

After a few times of resistance, I went big: invited her to ""smelter"" (about data analysis). result? We embark on a colorful journey of running deadlines ""together"":

Chasing deadlines, but still sitting on a plane from Hanoi to Da Nang, working with bosses and colleagues with a head full of data.

\- After the meeting, we went to the beach to eat grilled squid, but our hands were still on the phone waiting for emails from customers.

\- Watching Danang fireworks and walking around Hoi An ancient town, but my head is still buzzing with the unfinished presentation.

\- the view from the 18th floor is great, but the computer is hot from running reports overnight.

It sounds grand, but the truth is that we ""lost each other"" in the most unexpected way...

My lover is no longer the same person she used to be: from someone who didn't know what data analysis was, she is now proficient in her work, sees risks without me reminding her, and confidently communicates with customers. What about me? I presented everything: looker studio, sql, pbi,... and especially learned an important survival skill: ""tactfully handling your lover's dangerous questions"". Now, both have become new, better versions, and understand each other better. Having a companion on your career journey is truly a wonderful thing.

But just now she asked me: ""If you and my computer fall into the water, who will you save first?""

I think the most correct answer right now is:

""I'll save the computer first, because you know how to swim, right?""

or ""you save me first, then you and I save the computer together, great teamwork like the last deadline!""

If you have a better sentence, please help, but I feel a bit blind! 😅

Hình ảnh quen thuộc của mình là chàng trai ôm khư khư chiếc laptop từ sáng đến đêm. Đến mức, “người yêu” mình – đúng nghĩa đen chứ không phải chỉ laptop đâu – còn phát ghen với cái máy tính vì mình dành quá nhiều thời gian cho nó.

Ở công ty mình tư vấn, thảo luận đủ kiểu, nhưng về nhà thì lại không xử lý nổi “khách hàng khó tính” duy nhất của cuộc đời. Thế nhưng, đời không như là mơ. Laptop thì ngoan ngoãn, phục vụ mình bất kể ngày đêm, còn “người yêu” thì ngày một khó tính. Cô ấy còn thẳng thừng tuyên bố rằng: “A yêu laptop hơn cả yêu e, chả quan tâm đến e, a chán e rồi, chả yêu e, hix..”

Không giải quyết được vấn đề thì chúng ta giải quyết người tạo ra vấn đề thôi!

Sau vài lần chống chế, mình chơi lớn: rủ cô ấy đi “lò luyện” (về phân tích dữ liệu). Kết quả? Chúng mình bước vào hành trình chạy deadline “cùng nhau” đầy màu sắc:

Deadline dí, nhưng vẫn được ngồi máy bay từ Hà Nội vào Đà Nẵng, làm việc cùng sếp và đồng nghiệp với cái đầu đầy số liệu.

\- Họp xong là kéo nhau ra biển ăn mực nướng, nhưng tay vẫn lăm lăm điện thoại chờ email từ khách hàng.

\- Ngắm pháo hoa Đà Nẵng và dạo phố cổ Hội An, nhưng trong đầu vẫn ong ong bài thuyết trình chưa hoàn thiện.

\- View từ tầng 18 quá đỉnh, nhưng máy tính thì đang nóng ran vì chạy báo cáo xuyên đêm.

Nghe thì hoành tráng, nhưng sự thật là chúng mình đã “mất nhau” theo cách bất ngờ nhất….

Người yêu mình không còn là cô ấy ngày xưa nữa: từ một người chẳng biết phân tích dữ liệu là gì, giờ cô ấy đã thành thạo công việc, nhìn rủi ro mà không cần mình nhắc, còn tự tin trao đổi với khách hàng. Còn mình thì sao? Mình lên trình đủ thứ: Looker Studio, SQL, PBI,... và đặc biệt là biết thêm một kỹ năng sinh tồn quan trọng: ""Xử lý khéo léo các câu hỏi hiểm hóc của người yêu”. Giờ đây, cả hai đã thành phiên bản mới, xịn hơn, hiểu nhau hơn. Có người đồng hành trên hành trình sự nghiệp quả thật là điều tuyệt vời.

Nhưng mà nãy cô ấy lại hỏi mình: “Nếu như em và máy tính của anh rơi xuống nước thì anh cứu ai trước?”

Mình nghĩ câu trả lời đúng nhất lúc này là:

“Anh cứu máy tính trước, vì em biết bơi mà, đúng không?""

Hoặc “Anh cứu em trước, rồi em với anh cùng vớt máy tính, teamwork đỉnh cao như deadline vừa qua vậy!""

Hello everyone, now is almost the end of the first year of university, full of ambition and youthful enthusiasm for the red h school student. I participate in a union organization, an academic club and at the same time work as a class secretary, but I feel like I'm often pressed by deadlines and don't have enough time to study. That made my first semester GPA quite low (&lt;3.6) which is not the goal I set.  I also love everyone in the club very much, so I don't want to have to leave in my second year. I would like to ask everyone for ways to effectively manage their time, ensure extracurricular activities, achieve a high GPA every semester (if you have a scholarship, even better) and still occasionally participate in a few competitions to gain experience. Thank you!","Quản lý thời gian trên Đại học hiệu quả! Xin chào mọi người, đến nay là cũng gần hết năm nhất Đại học đầy hoài bão và nhiệt huyết tuổi trẻ của em trường H màu đỏ.

187jfoq,1701353506.0,2023-11-30 14:11:46,"What does a child living in a single-parent family experience? (part 1: sharing my heart) I was born in 2003, I want to talk about my journey over the past 20 years so that people can understand what I've been through and my aspirations for the future. Everyone, just think of me as reading someone's diary.

\-1 year old: parents divorced, mother took her to live with her maternal family including grandmother, a married step-aunt and 2 little boys.

\-About my parents: my father is a waste in my eyes, he only provides support twice a year, calls a few times a year, never comes to visit like other people's fathers. When I passed university, he stopped providing support, gifts and cakes took a long time to come. My mother is 10 points, both beautiful, talented and super easy-going. From childhood to adulthood, I was rarely scolded by my mother, never spanking or being overly imposing, different from other people. What I see in other people's mothers. She often volunteers, is a vegetarian, participates in short-term retreats and loves Buddhism. She hopes to live in a temple or go back to her hometown to buy a small house and live peacefully alone when she gets old, without having to worry about her children.

\-kindergarten: my mother worked for a garment company. I was assigned to my grandmother's family or her friends to take care of me on my days off. Luckily, I was loved by both sides, given toys, enough food, cakes, fruits, cartoons, etc. But I learned to feel sorry for myself from an early age. At school, my friends were picked up by their parents, but I was only allowed to do that by my grandmother's family or the homeroom teacher (who was also my mother's friend).

\-level 1: mother gradually advances thanks to experience + has a red hcmut certificate from before, life is less miserable. I always strived to be a student throughout elementary school. But I was often ridiculed and disparaged by my friends in the neighborhood and a few mean neighbors because I was poor and my parents were divorced. In return, I had the opportunity to hang out with 2 female friends from the same family background in the neighborhood, who have been friends for more than 10 years now.

\-9 years old: because of ''my anger'', I slapped a girl from a group of bullies in the neighborhood and her nose bled because she insulted my mother. At that time, I was so scared that I ran back to cry with my grandmother. Her parents came over to talk to my grandmother's family. Thanks to the support of my two close friends and their families, the neighbor's aunt and uncle witnessed the ferocity of my maternal family, I was spared, and the other girl's parents did not make things difficult for me anymore. My two close friends and I have since escaped being bullied by that group.

\-11 years old: the year that changed the rest of my life later. God loved my mother and let her win a special lottery with 5 tickets to buy support. After finishing elementary school, mother and daughter said goodbye to their grandmother's house, moved to Saigon to build a new life with the money that fell from the sky.

\-secondary school: my mother bought an old apartment in district 9, registered me in a secondary school in the district. The remaining amount was combined with an additional loan to open a company + invest in land. I still tried to study well, helping my mother with housework to share the burden to help her. I was so used to my mother coming home early and coming home late, sometimes I slept at the company. I had to ride my bike to school by myself, and in addition to studying at school, I also had to take extra classes and take piano lessons.

\-14 years old: I got rid of the after effects of being bullied in the past by bullying the girl at my desk. Not only did she not study well, but she was also dark and shy. She was always isolated and was bullied by some classmates. I always pinched her hand every time she couldn't solve a problem on the board. Every time I showed her a lesson, she deliberately gave me a difficult problem to solve. If she couldn't solve it, I would criticize her and let her parents take care of her. How hard it is to study hard to create pressure. At test time, I will leave you alone by sitting with my partner and letting you sit alone. There are a few times I bad-mouthed your friend to my best friend in the same class as the homeroom teacher.

\-16 years old: my mother's business increased and she got lucky, I got into a public high school in another district, and was constantly pressured by luck. Mother and I had to pack up and live in a 200m2 house, starting a series of days of good food, driving a car, having a few real estate to save, traveling everywhere from here. But my mother changed 180 degrees, she often went online to earn 419 odds a couple of times a week, even to Even my business partner was not spared. I ignored myself, became a vegetarian, followed Buddhism, and regularly went to the temple. I started to lose a lot of affection for my mother from here. My ability to study also went down, and throughout high school, no matter how hard I tried, I could only get good grades, so miserable, everyone.

\-17 years old: won the 1st runner-up prize in the school's elegance contest. I participated because I was bullied by the whole class, and have had a bit of aura in school since then. A few months later, I quietly went to a psychologist and was diagnosed with moderate-level depression, a result of my perfectionist personality along with past trauma. I started a series of days of being friends with alcohol and cigarettes for 4 years now but still I try to hide it from everyone. I still disguise myself as an elegant, sociable, confident person with my friends, playing my role.","Một đứa trẻ sống trong gia đình đơn thân trải qua những gì ? (Phần 1: Trải lòng) Mình sn 2003 ,mình muốn tâm sự về hành trình 20 năm qua của mình để người hiểu những gì mình trải qua và những nguyện vọng của mình trong tương lai.Mọi người cứ coi như mình đang đọc nhật ký của ai đó đi.

\-1 tuổi : Bố mẹ ly hôn,được mẹ ẵm về sống với nhà ngoại gồm bà ngoại,một dì kế đã có gia đình và 2 cậu nhỏ.

\-Về bố mẹ mình : Bố là thứ bỏ đi trong mắt mình , ông ấy chỉ cấp dưỡng 1 năm 2 lần ,gọi điện ít lần mỗi năm,chưa bao giờ đến thăm nom giống bố nhà người ta.Năm mình đậu Đại học thì ngưng chu cấp,quà bánh thì lâu lắm mới có.Mẹ mình thì 10 điểm ,vừa đẹp vừa giỏi và siêu dễ tính.Từ nhỏ đến lớn mình ít bị mẹ mắng lắm,đòn roi hay áp đặt thái quá thì chưa bao giờ,khác với những gì mình thấy ở mẹ nhà người ta.Mẹ thường xuyên đi thiện nguyện,ăn chay,tham gia các khóa tu ngắn hạn và yêu đạo Phật.Có nguyện vọng sẽ sống trong chùa hoặc về quê mua nhà nhỏ sống yên ổn một mình khi về già, không cần con cái lo.

\-Mẫu giáo: Mẹ làm cho công ty may,mình được giao cho nhà ngoại hoặc bạn bè mẹ chăm vào ngày nghỉ .May mắn là ở bên nào cũng được yêu thương,được cho đồ chơi,ăn uống đầy đủ, cho bánh trái ,đĩa hoạt hình các thứ.Nhưng mình biết tủi thân từ sớm,ở trường bạn bè được bố mẹ đưa rước thì mình chỉ được nhà ngoại hoặc cô chủ nhiệm(cũng là bạn của mẹ) làm điều đó.

\-Cấp 1 : Mẹ dần thăng tiến nhờ kinh nghiệm+có bằng đỏ HCMUT từ trước,cuộc sống đỡ khổ hơn. Mình luôn phấn đấu là hsg suốt cấp 1. Nhưng mình hay bị mấy bạn trong xóm cùng số ít cô chú hàng xóm xấu tính chế giễu,miệt thị vì đã nghèo mà bố mẹ còn ly hôn. Bù lại, mình có duyên chơi được với 2 bạn nữ cùng gia cảnh trong xóm, thân đến nay hơn 10 năm rồi.

\-9 tuổi : Vì ''tức nước vỡ bờ'' , mình tát một bạn nữ của nhóm bắt nạt trong xóm chảy máu mũi vì bạn ấy xúc phạm tới mẹ mình .Lúc ấy sợ quá mà chạy về khóc với ngoại, bố mẹ bạn ấy qua nói chuyện với nhà ngoại.Nhờ sự bênh vực của 2 bạn thân cùng gia đình 2 bạn,  cô chú hàng xóm chứng kiến cùng với sự hung dữ của nhà ngoại mà mình được tha, bố mẹ bạn kia không làm khó dễ gì nữa. Mình với 2 bạn thân từ đó thoát khỏi việc bị bắt nạt từ đám kia luôn.

\-11 tuổi : Cái năm đã thay đổi phần đời còn lại của mình sau này.Ông trời thương mẹ mà cho mẹ TRÚNG SỐ đặc biệt tận 5 tờ mua ủng hộ.Học xong cấp 1,hai mẹ con tạm biệt nhà ngoại , dọn lên Sài Gòn gây dựng cuộc sống mới với số tiền trên trời rớt xuống kia.

\-Cấp 2 : Mẹ mua chung cư cũ bên Q9 ,đăng ký cho mình vào một một trường cấp 2 trong quận.Còn nhiêu thì kết hợp với vay thêm để mở công ty+đầu tư đất.Mình vẫn cố gắng học thật giỏi,phụ mẹ việc nhà để san sẻ bớt gánh nặng giúp mẹ.Quá quen với việc mẹ đi sớm về khuya,đôi lần ngủ lại ở công ty luôn.Mình phải tự đạp xe đi học,ngoài học trên trường còn phải học thêm,học piano.

\-14 tuổi :Mình thanh lọc những di chứng do bị bắt nạt trong quá khứ bằng cách bắt nạt bạn nữ cùng bàn , bạn ấy không những học kém mà còn đen đúa,nhút nhát.Bạn ấy luôn bị cô lập,từng bị một số bạn trong lớp bắt nạt.Mình luôn cấu véo tay bạn mỗi khi bạn ấy không giải được bài trên bảng, lần nào chỉ bài đều cố tình lấy bài khó cho bạn giải , không giải được thì sẽ chỉ trích ,đem việc bố mẹ bạn nuôi bạn ăn học cực khổ ra sao để gây áp lực.Vào giờ kiểm tra thì mình sẽ bỏ mặc bạn bằng cách chuyển qua ngồi với đứa chơi chung ,cho bạn ngồi một mình.Có ít lần nói xấu bạn ấy cho bạn thân cùng lớp với cô chủ nhiệm.

\-16 tuổi :Mẹ làm ăn lên kèm theo trúng đất ,mình đậu vào một trường cấp 3 công lập ở quận khác , liên tục bị may mắn chèn ép.Hai mẹ con phải cuốn gói xuống đất ở căn nhà 200m2,bắt đầu chuỗi ngày tháng ăn ngon, đi ô tô, có vài bđs để dành, du lịch khắp nơi từ đây.Nhưng mẹ thay đổi 180 độ,bà ấy hay lên mạng kiếm kèo 419 mỗi tuần đôi lần, thậm chí đến cả đối tác làm ăn cũng không tha.Mặc kệ bản thân ăn chay,theo Phật,thường xuyên đi chùa.Mình bắt đầu mất đi nhiều tình cảm với mẹ từ đây.Sức học cũng đi xuống ,suốt cấp 3 dù cố mấy cũng chỉ được loại Khá ,khổ sở lắm mọi người ạ.

\-17 tuổi : Đạt giải Á khôi 1 trong cuộc thi thanh lịch trường tổ chức,mình tham gia do bị cả lớp dí,có chút ít hào quang trong trường từ đó.Mấy tháng sau, mình âm thầm đi khám tâm lý,được chuẩn đoán là bị t,r,ầ,m c,ả,m+ rlla cấp độ Vừa,thành quả từ tính cách cầu toàn cùng với tổn thương trong quá khứ làm nên.Bắt đầu chuỗi ngày làm bạn với rượu bia,thuốc lá đến nay được 4 năm nhưng vẫn cố giấu tất cả mọi người.Mình vẫn ngụy trang thành một đứa thanh lịch,hòa đồng,tự tin với bạn bè, diễn tròn vai đứa con gương mẫu trước mặt mẹ và người lớn.Hằng ngày phải đeo mặt nạ để sống.

\-18 tuổi : Có duyên với đạo Công giáo, mình thích nó rất nhiều dù là Phật tử, thường xuyên đi lễ từ đây .Nhưng bên cạnh đó cũng biết đến mấy club và quán nhậu, mình đi một mình 1 lần/tuần khi stress.Đậu được trường đại học kèm theo ngành mình thích với sự ủng hộ của mẹ.Cùng 2 cô bạn thân đi chuyến du lịch đầu tiên của 3 đứa với số tiền nuôi ống heo chung được mấy năm ,ăn mừng cả đám đều đậu Đại học.Đi gần 1 tháng tính nốt mấy ngày bị cách ly luôn.

\-19 tuổi -&gt; Nay : Mẹ mua căn hộ bên Q7 với ô tô để sang tên cho mình ,chu cấp mỗi tháng để sống riêng 4 năm đại học.Mình vẫn đi làm thêm từ chạy bàn, nhân viên siêu thị cho đến mẫu ảnh.Nếu khuya không có deadline , mất ngủ thì rượu bia,thuốc lá hoặc đi lễ online.Cuối tuần thường đi nhà thờ rồi đi quẩy,lâu lâu sẽ đi thiện nguyện hoặc tụ tập bạn bè đi chơi xa,đi khám tâm lý 2 lần/tháng và đang trong quá trình lấy bằng B1.

  Giờ mình chỉ muốn học xong đại học, đi du học thạc sĩ theo ý muốn của mẹ, xong về nước làm việc cho mẹ. Mình kiên định với việc không yêu đương, lập gia đình vì tỷ lệ ly hôn bây giờ bị lạm phát.Chưa kể bây giờ xuất hiện nhiều vấn nạn hôn nhân quá( ngoại tình,blgđ ,toan tính tài sản...).Mình cũng mặc cảm sâu sắc về lai lịch của mình (bố mẹ ly hôn + mẹ lăng nhăng).Chắc chắn sau này quen ai đều sẽ bị đối phương kèm theo nhà trai khinh thường,kì thị,mối quan hệ sẽ không đi đến đâu hết.Những lí do ấy giúp mình có nghị lực sống độc thân cả đời để sống vì bản thân hơn,bên cạnh chăm lo cho mẹ đến khi mẹ sang tên công ty cùng cả gia tài qua cho mình.

 Có được mọi thứ ,mình sẽ đưa mẹ vào viện dưỡng lão để từ mặt,hằng tháng chỉ trả thật nhiều tiền cho viện để người ta giam mẹ ,còn không thì vẫn sẽ giữ lại mẹ để làm bao cát giải tỏa tiêu cực trong người,vừa tránh việc bị mang tiếng bất hiếu với người ngoài,tìm cách để mẹ sống khổ tuổi già.Một người mẹ lăng nhăng,không sạch sẽ, mẫu mực giống mẹ nhà người ta ,làm con cái bị mặc cảm kèm theo bị mang tiếng với người đời như bà ấy không xứng đáng để mình làm tròn đạo hiếu.Tiếp đến,mình sẽ kiểm soát cuộc sống của bản thân chỉ xoay quanh tiền bạc,sự nghiệp,chất kích thích và trị liệu tâm lý ,gia nhập thẳng vào đạo Công giáo luôn.Về già mình muốn bán sạch gia tài,lấy tiền để trả nợ mẹ vay làm ăn,đi du lịch,làm từ thiện,ủng hộ các chùa với nhà thờ.Trích ra một khoản để mang vô viện dưỡng lão,sống một mình trong viện qua ngày cho đến khi không còn thở thôi mọi người ạ.","what do a child living a single - parent family experience ?

Before, I did internships and was late to work, so they kicked me out. After that, I worked somewhere else and finally landed at a company in district 3. I did a little internship and then officially got a job recently with a salary of 8.5 million gross. I was afraid that my family would worry so I said 11 cars. My mother's car was sent to Singapore to work. Everyone in my family expected me to be able to buy an AB by the end of the year. I planned to save up to buy one by the end of the year, but with the salary situation being low, I didn't know how to save up to buy it. Thinking about going back to my hometown, everyone was talking about my salary being 1x less. 2x bulbs but I'm so stressed, all my friends are paid 1x, 2x... I'm 8x bulbs, thinking about this issue makes me depressed :(( Thank you everyone for taking the time to read my confession.  
**edit: (let me add more)**   
Because before I was a specialized student, everyone expected a lot from me, and I lived in the countryside, so my relatives expected me to go to Saigon to graduate school and get a good salary.

I don't worry about his tuition, but I do worry about his food and living expenses.

Normally, I don't think much about money because I think the amount I work for is enough to cover my two meals. But lately my mother often pressures me because at my age I don't have to work 2-3 jobs at a time, nor do I have a side job. My mother keeps urging me to come up with a strategy, but if I open a shop or a company of some kind, then I will be rich, but if I just keep earning a salary, I won't be able to make it.

Actually, I think what my mother said makes sense, but I feel like the pressure is too much, because I feel like I'm too young and I don't have any capital yet.

I often read stories on here, seeing everyone suffering but it still doesn't scare me enough, I feel even more discouraged. I aspired to be a top school, but for more than a year I've been so exhausted, now that I'm studying for the retake the course, I'm even more exhausted. I hope you guys can share the truth about the pressure of going to work, or even threaten me, so that I can be motivated to continue studying

I am obsessed with learning. I'm haunted every time I have to carry my body to school, every time I see a difficult problem, I'm dumbfounded, not knowing what to do next. I'm a senior student, not the type of student with weak academic performance. In grades 8, 9, 10, I all had provincial awards (though only at the consolation level), and in grade 11, I failed. but years 10 and 11 still have scholarships. I am majoring in information technology, and am also the only girl in the class pursuing this subject until now. Most of the other girls have changed directions.

I don't hate studying at school, but I'm not good at it either. The current problem is that I'm having a headache because I'm focusing on practicing ilets and reviewing specialized subjects, hoping that the specialized subjects will get a higher score for university admission. But now I'm really too exhausted, too haunted. Every day I practice tests in a tired state. If I don't know anything, I study according to online instructions but still feel stuffy because everything is difficult and too much, and I'm mentally exhausted. Sometimes I want to watch this movie or read that book but I don't dare. Even if I watch it, I still feel guilty about wasting my time studying. Even if I sit at my desk and study, I'm stuck and I don't learn much.

The other day I argued with my father about studying, I got mad and scratched my face. Actually, I wonder how tiring it is to go to work, or should I just stop studying, just study average, go to average school, work average, live a life of a little deprivation, but it's too frustrating.

I know that wanting to have a stable job and good academic performance is only one part, there are many other factors needed such as communication skills, relationship building and so on. If possible, I hope you guys and aunts can share with me some necessary skills besides studying.

Em chán nản quá, cần thêm lý do để cố gắng học tập hơn Công việc của các bác thế nào ạ? Có mệt hơn học không? Em hay đọc mấy tâm sự trên này, thấy ai cũng khổ mà vẫn chưa đủ làm em sợ, em còn thấy nản hơn nhiều. Nguyện vọng là trường top đầu mà hơn 1 năm nay em đuối quá, giờ ôn đại học lại càng đuối hơn. Mong các bác chia sẻ thật về áp lực đi làm, dọa em cũng được, để em có động lực học tiếp

Em bị ám ảnh bởi việc học. Ám ảnh mỗi khi phải vác xác đi học, mỗi lần nhìn thấy một đề bài khó, em chết lặng luôn, ko biết bản thân phải làm gì tiếp theo. Em là học sinh cuối cấp, không phải kiểu học lực yếu, những năm lớp 8, 9, 10 em đều có giải tỉnh (dù chỉ ở mức khuyến khích), lớp 11 thì rớt giải. Nhưng năm 10 và 11 vẫn có học bổng. Em đang học chuyên tin, cũng là đứa con gái duy nhất trong lớp theo đuổi môn này đến tận thời điểm hiện tại. Hầu hết các bạn nữ khác đều đã chuyển hướng.

Em không ghét việc học trên trường, nhưng cũng không giỏi. Vấn đề hiện tại là em đang đau đầu vì tập trung vào luyện ilets và ôn môn chuyên, hy vọng môn chuyên đạt giải cao hơn để xét tuyển đại học. Nhưng giờ thật sự em đã quá đuối, quá ám ảnh. Ngày nào cũng luyện đề trong tình trạng mệt mỏi, cái gì ko biết thì học theo hướng dẫn trên mạng mà vẫn cảm thấy nghẹt vì mọi thứ đều khó, nhiều, còn tinh thần thì cạn kiệt. Đôi khi cũng muốn xem phim này, đọc cuốn sách kia mà cũng ko dám, dù có xem thì cũng cảm thấy cắn rứt vì lãng phí thời gian học. Mà có vào bàn học cũng lay hoay là hết, chả học được gì mấy.

Hôm nọ em cãi nhau với bố về chuyện học, em nổi điên cào rách cả mặt. Thực sự em tự hỏi đi làm nó mệt như nào, hay là thôi.. không học nữa, mình cứ học trung bình vào trường trung bình, làm việc trung bình, sống cuộc đời thiếu thốn một chút cũng được chứ nản quá.

Em biết muốn làm việc ổn định, học lực giỏi chỉ là một phần, còn cần nhiều yếu tố khác như kỹ năng giao tiếp, tạo dựng mối quan hệ các thứ. Nếu được, mong các bác, các thím chia sẻ giúp em thêm mấy kỹ năng cần thiết ngoài chuyện học với ạ.

1i5s9hs,1737385781.0,2025-01-20 15:09:41,"pressure of life, I gradually feel tired, disoriented and have negative thoughts. I am a male born in 2001, just graduated in June 2024, currently studying unity. In 2024, I worked as a programmer at a small web company, the company was not too big, just a small company that allowed hybrid work, the brothers and sisters were friendly and sociable. But then I felt like I wasn't working effectively, so I quit my job there at the end of 2024. I decided that I wanted to try games because I wanted to make a game that I liked. but then at the present time I feel like I'm about to reach my limit, doubting whether I will really become better and achieve what I want when I continue to pursue my current thinking. Am I making a mistake?

Before, when I was studying, I always daydreamed and imagined a rosy life working in the IT field, dreaming about myself making cool things. I personally really like war topics, so I dream of making a Vietnam War game like 7554, with beautiful graphics like battlefield or call of duty games. I often dream about many things, but when I actually experience it, I realize that the journey is extremely arduous and that I am so small and stupid when I keep holding on to dreams like a child. I once told my family about switching to studying game making. When I said it, my parents didn't understand and strongly objected. Because my parents often thought that what I was doing was playing games to make money. Even though I explained about creating game products, they strongly objected. I also have a sister who works as a QA at Opswat and also said that making games doesn't make much money and is not sustainable. My parents all said they were doing one thing and then jumping to another, not knowing how to measure themselves. Many times I feel like I'm wrong. After more than half a year of graduating from work and then quitting my job to pursue what I wanted, now I feel really tired. After half a year, my nearsightedness has increased. I have a history of congenital heart disease. From time to time, my heart keeps aching because of staying up late and constantly having headaches. Now I feel confused, I'm unemployed, I feel lifeless, I've lost direction, and sometimes I think about not wanting to exist anymore.

Currently, I'm just starting to research about unity, but I'm always afraid, I always think I should have started earlier or done this sooner, I'm afraid I'm too late to do or learn something now. I always feel self-conscious about myself. Can you or anyone who is working in this field give me sincere advice? Thank you.","Áp lực cuộc sống, bản thân dần cảm thấy mệt mỏi mất định hướng và có những suy nghĩ tiêu cực Mình là nam sinh năm 2001, vừa mới ra trường tháng 6 năm 2024 , hiện tại mình đang học Unity. Trong năm 2024 mình từng làm lập trình viên ở 1 công ty nhỏ về web, công ty không quá to chỉ là 1 công ty nhỏ cho phép làm hybrid, các anh chị hòa đồng thân thiện. nhưng rồi sau đó cảm thấy làm việc không hiệu quả nên mình nghỉ việc ở đó cuối năm 2024. Bản thân quyết định là muốn thử sức với game vì muốn làm ra game mà bản thân thích. Nhưng rồi ở thời điểm hiện tại mình cảm thấy bản thân mình sắp chạm tới giới hạn, hoài nghi liệu mình có thực sự sẽ trở nên giỏi hơn và đạt được những gì mình muốn khi mình tiếp tục theo đuổi suy nghĩ hiện tại. Liệu mình có đang sai lầm.

Trước đây lúc học mình luôn mơ mộng và tưởng tượng về cuộc sống màu hồng khi làm việc trong lĩnh vực IT, mơ về bản thân sẽ làm ra những thứ hay ho. Bản thân mình cực kì thích về đề tài chiến tranh nên mình mơ ước bản thân sẽ làm ra 1 tựa game đề tài chiến tranh việt nam như 7554, đồ họa đẹp như của các dòng game battlefield hay Call of duty. Mình hay mơ mộng nhiều thứ lắm nhưng khi thực sự trải nghiệm thì mình mới nhận ra, hành trình thì cực kì gian nan mà bản thân thì thật nhỏ bé và dần độn khi cứ ôm những giấc mơ như trẻ con. Mình từng nói với gia đình về việc sẽ chuyển qua học làm game, khi mình nói ra thì ba mẹ mình không hiểu và kịch liệt phản đối, tại ba mẹ mình hay suy nghĩ thứ mình đang làm là chơi game kiếm tiền, mặc dù mình đã giải thích về việc tạo ra sản phẩm game nhưng họ kịch liệt phản đối, mình cũng có người chị làm QA ở OPSWAT cũng bảo là làm game thì không có kiếm nhiều tiền và cũng không có bền. Ba mẹ đều bảo đang làm cái này rồi còn nhảy qua cái khác, không biết tự lượng sức mình. Nhiều lúc mình cảm thấy bản thân thật sai lầm. Sau hơn nửa năm ra trường đi làm rồi lại nghỉ việc để chạy theo cái mà bản thân muốn, bây giờ mình cảm thấy thật sự là mệt mỏi, nửa năm mà độ cận của mắt thì tăng lên, mình lại có tiểu sử bệnh tim bẩm sinh, lâu lâu tim mình cứ đau nhói lên vì những hôm thức khuya, liên tục đau đầu. Giờ mình cảm thấy mông lung, bản thân thì thất nghiệp, cảm giác không còn sức sống, mất định hướng nhiều lúc mình cũng suy nghĩ về việc không muốn tồn tại nữa.

Hiện tại mình đang mới bắt đầu nghiên cứu về unity, nhưng mình cứ lo sợ, mình luôn suy nghĩ đáng ra mình nên bắt đầu sớm hơn hoặc làm điều này sớm hơn, mình sợ bản thân bây giờ quá trễ để làm hoặc tìm hiểu 1 cái gì đó. Mình luôn cảm thấy tự ti về bản thân. Anh/chị hay bạn nào đang làm ở mảng này có thể cho mình xin lời khuyên chân thành không ạ mình cảm ơn.","pressure life , i gradually feel tired , disorient have negative thought . i a male bear 2001 , just graduate june 2024 , currently study unity . 2024 , i work a a programmer a small web company , company not too big , just a small company allow hybrid work , brother sister friendly sociable . then i felt like i wasn't work effectively , i quit my job there end 2024 . i decide i want try game because i want make a game i like . then present timei feel like i'm about reach my limit , doubt whether i will really become good achieve what i want when i continue pursue my current thinking . i make a mistake ? before , when i study , i always daydream imagine a rosy life work field , dream about myself make cool thing . i personally really like war topic , i dream make a vietnam war game like 7554 , beautiful graphic like battlefield call duty game . i often dream about many thing , when i actually experience , i realize journey extremely arduous i small stupid when i keep hold dream like a child . i once tell my family about switch study game making . when i say , my parent didn't understand strongly object . because my parent often think what i do play game make money . even though i explain about create game product , they strongly object . i also have a sister who work a a qa opswat also say make game doesn't make much money not sustainable . my parent all say they do one thing then jump another , not know how measure themselves . many time i feel like i'm wrong . after more than half a year graduate from work then quit my job pursue what i want , now i feel really tire . after half a year , my nearsightedness have increase . i have a history congenital heart disease . from time time , my heart keep ache because stay up late constantly have headache . now i feel confuse , i'm unemployed , i feel lifeless , i've lose direction , sometimes i think about not want exist anymore . currently , i'm just start research about unity , i'm always afraid , i always think i should have start earlier do sooner , i'm afraid i'm too late do learn something now . i always feel self - conscious about myself . can you anyone who work field give me sincere advice ? thank you .",Depression

1csrdle,1715796281.0,2024-05-15 18:04:41,"I give a few personal opinions about pressure on students. I am still a student, currently in grade 12 and all opinions below are personal opinions.

I'm just a student at a normal c3 school in the province (top 2 top 3), not a specialized school. When I was in c2, my goal was to pass the exam and I found it not too difficult, because actually, according to my personal assessment, the high school exam is very common and suitable for all students. Just by studying and doing all the exercises in class, it is possible to get a score of 7.5 or higher, and I think with a score of 7.5 to 8 points in each subject, you are enough to get into a good quality high school. It doesn't have too much pressure on studying as people often say unless the goal is to enter provincial/city specialized schools. 

Next is the university exam. I think the university exam is difficult and the learning pressure is greater than the high school exam. Most people have the goal of getting into hot majors at the top schools. The basic score to pass the requirements will range from 25.5 to 27.5, which is average (8.5 to 9.25 per subject). This is the standard score of the majors I refer to at northern universities. And I think it's more difficult than the c3 exam, but it's not really as stressful as people say. I don't know how the new training program has the exam mechanism, but according to the old program, I only focused mainly on 3 main exam subjects (like math, physics, English) and I tried from 5 points up to 8 points and even 9 points (physics). According to my personal assessment, this score is completely within the student's ability if the student diligently does the exercises and tests. and there are also many other admission methods such as hsa, tsa, talent admission, or studying transcripts, international certificates... (some people choose to study only English to take the certificate exam, then combine the transcripts to pass)
As a student still in the process of studying for exams, I think it's really not as stressful as people say (with the condition of voluntarily studying and doing all the exercises). 
Let's talk a little about the two 9th graders in the last story. I don't know if it's because the family is too pressured on them or not, but I think the responsibility here belongs to both education and the family. Vietnam's education system is still lacking in teaching children life skills. In fact, Vietnam is very weak in comprehensive development of students and only focuses on learning subjects.
The family's problem is that the family has not been able to give the children an environment where they can talk about their problems. 
The responsibility here does not just belong to one person but to the whole society.","Em đưa ra 1 ít ý kiến cả nhân về việc áp lực học sinh hiện nay  Em vẫn đang là học sinh , nay đang học lớp 12 và tất cả ý kiến dưới này là ý kiến cá nhân

Em chỉ là 1 học sinh trường c3 bình thường ở tỉnh( top 2 top 3 ) chứ không phải trường chuyên. Khi em  học c2 đã có mục tiêu là đỗ vào trường và em thấy nó không quá khó, vì thật sự là theo đánh giá cá nhân của em bài thi cấp 3 rất phổ thông và vừa sức với mọi học sinh. Chỉ cần học bài và làm bài đầy đủ trên lớp là hoàn toàn có thể đạt 7,5 trở lên và em nghĩ với số điểm 7.5 đến 8 điểm mỗi môn là đã đủ khả năng để đỗ vào trường cấp 3 chất lượng tốt. Nó không có áp lực quá nặng về việc học tập như mọi người vẫn hay bảo trừ khi mục tiêu là vào những trường chuyên tỉnh/ thành phố 

Tiếp đến thì là thi đại học, thì em đánh giá thi đại học khó và áp lực học tập lớn hơn thi cấp 3. Đa số mọi người đều có mục tiêu là đỗ vào các ngành hot ở các trường top trên. Mức điểm cơ bản để đỗ các nguyện vọng  sẽ dao động từ 25,5- 27,5, tức là trung bình (8.5 đến 9.25 mỗi môn). Đây là điểm chuẩn các ngành em tham khảo ở các trường đại học miền bắc. Và em đánh giá nó khó hơn so với kì thi C3 nhưng nó cũng kh thật sự áp lực như mọi người hay nói. Em không biết chương trình đào tạo mới có cơ chế thi như thế nào nhưng theo chương trình cũ thì em chỉ tập trung chủ đạo vào 3 môn thi chính khối ( như em là toán , lý , anh ) và em đã thử từ 5 điểm lên đến 8 điểm và cả 9 điểm( môn lý ). Theo đánh giá cá nhân của em thì mức điểm này là hoàn toàn trong khả năng của học sinh nếu học sinh chăm chỉ làm bài tập và luyện đề. Và cũng có rất nhiều phương thức xét tuyển khác như HSA, TSA, xét tuyển tài năng, hay xét học bạ, chứng chỉ quốc tế ....( có những bạn chọn học mỗi tiếng anh để thi chứng chỉ sau đó kết hợp học bạ là đã đủ đỗ)
Với vị trí vẫn đang là 1 học sinh đang trong quá trình ôn thi thì em đánh giá rằng thật sự nó không áp lực như mọi người nói( với điều kiện tự giác học bài làm bài tập đầy đủ ) 
Nói 1 chút chuyện về 2 em học sinh lớp 9 trong câu chuyện vừa qua, em không biết có phải do.gia đình quá áp lực nên các em hay không nhưng em nghĩ rằng trách nhiệm ở đây là thuộc về cả giáo dục và cả gia đình. Nền giáo dục VN vẫn còn thiếu xót trong việc dạy trẻ em các kỹ năng sống, thật sự VN rất yếu trong khoản phát triển toàn diện cho học sinh mà chỉ tập trung vào học tập môn học.
Vấn đề của gia đình là gia đình đã không thể cho các em một môi trường để các em có thể nói ra vấn đề của bản thân. 
Trách nhiệm ở đây không chỉ thuộc về riêng ai mà đó là của cả xã hội. ","i give a few personal opinion about pressure student . i still a student , currently grade 12 all opinion below personal opinion . i'm just a student a normal c3 school province ( top 2 top 3 ), not a specialized school . when i c2 , my goal pass exam i find not too difficult , because actually , accord my personal assessment , high school exam very common suitable all student . just study do all exercise class , possible get a score 7 . 5 high , i think a score 7 . 5 8 point each subject , you enough get into a good quality high school . doesn't have too much pressure study a people often say unless goal enter provincial / city specialize school . next university exam . i think university exam difficult learning pressure great than high school exam . most people have goal get into hot major top school . basic score pass requirement will range from 25 . 5 27 . 5 , which average ( 8 . 5 9 . 25 per subject ). standard score major i refer northern university . i think it's more difficult than c3 exam , it's not really stressful a people say . i don't know how new training program have exam mechanism , accord old program , i only focus mainly 3 main exam subject ( like math , physic , english ) i try from 5 point up 8 point even 9 point ( physic ). accord my personal assessment , score completely within student's ability if student diligently do exercise test . there also many other admission method such a hsa , tsa , talent admission , study transcript , international certificate ...

I (21f) just quit my job at the industrial park after a month of working at the professional office. To be frank, at first the apprenticeship was fine, I was also accepted as quite brave, willing to ask questions about studying, but because I couldn't stand the pressure there + was allergic to the ingredients + was ignored by my colleagues + only had HSK4 in Chinese so I was discouraged.

When I was in high school, my academic performance wasn't that bad. I passed the university entrance exam in English language. I chose this major because I'm not good at math and my basic English is not bad. In semesters 1 and 2, my results were okay, but then I dropped out. I don't blame anyone, the economy is part of it, mostly because that year I didn't have the will and wanted to play so I quit. My parents were sad but they didn't pressure me at all. After a few months of staying at home just playing games, my parents directed me to learn Chinese.
My process of learning Chinese is also not going smoothly. I retaked the basic course 3 times within half a year because all the classes I took had students drop out and there weren't enough students so the class was cancelled. She also got cheated on in love and went through depression for about half a year, making her parents worried.
I just passed the hsk4 exam last month, however my Chinese is only good at a basic level, I can chat just fine but I don't have too much vocabulary. Last summer, I confided to my family that I would consider my transcript to go to college, and having a degree would probably be better. But my parents and older brother all suggested that I should probably go to work to make money now, and now my family doesn't have enough money to support me in studying for a few years.

I've been off work for a week. I plan to take my salary and use that money to study for HSK5. But a part of me also wants to improve my English, but now I'm experiencing a feeling of loss of motivation...

Thank you to those who took the time to read this article of mine. Surely there will be people who read it and feel angry, I also understand that I was too impulsive at that time...","Cảm thấy bản thân là kẻ loser Chào các bác, đừng vội ném đá em, nhưng nếu muốn mắng cho em khôn ra thì đó là điều mà em đang thực sự cần.

Em (21F) vừa nghỉ việc tại khu CN sau một tháng làm việc tại văn phòng nghiệp vụ. Nói thẳng ra là ban đầu học việc cũng ổn, em cũng được nx là khá bạo, chịu hỏi han học tập, nhưng vì em không chịu được áp lực ở đó + bị dị ứng nguyên liệu+ bị đồng nghiệp đì + tiếng Trung chỉ mới Hsk4 nên em nản.

Ngày còn đi học trung học, thành tích học tập của em cũng không đến nỗi tệ. Em từng đỗ đh ngành Ngôn Ngữ Anh, em chọn ngành này vì em không giỏi Toán, tiếng Anh cơ bản em cũng không tệ. Học kỳ 1 và 2 thành tích em cũng ổn, nhưng sau đó em bỏ học. Em không đổ tại ai, kinh tế là một phần, phần lớn do năm đó không có ý chí, ham chơi nên nghỉ, ba mẹ cũng buồn nhưng không gây áp lực em gì cả. Sau vài tháng nghỉ ở nhà chỉ chơi game, ba mẹ hướng em đi học tiếng Trung.
Quá trình học tiếng Trung của em cũng ko được suôn sẻ. Em từng học lại khoá cơ bản 3 lần trong vòng nửa năm do tất cả các lớp em học học sinh đều bỏ dở, không đủ học sinh nên lớp huỷ. Còn từng bị lừa tình, trải qua trầm cảm khoảng nửa năm, làm cha mẹ lo lắng.
Em vừa thi đỗ Hsk4 tháng trước, tuy nhiên tiếng Trung của em chỉ tốt ở mức cơ bản, nói chuyện phiếm cũng được mà từ vựng em không có quá nhiều. Hè vừa rồi em có tâm sự với gia đình rằng em sẽ xét học bạ để học đại học, có tấm bằng có lẽ vẫn hơn. Nhưng ba mẹ và anh trai em đều góp ý rằng hiện tại em có lẽ nên đi làm kiếm tiền đi, vả lại bây giờ gia đình không đủ kinh tế nuôi em học mấy năm.

Em nghỉ làm được một tuần rồi. Em dự định lấy lương về sẽ dùng tiền đó học lên Hsk5. Nhưng một phần nào đó em cũng muốn cải thiện lại tiếng Anh của mình, nhưng giờ đây em đang trải qua cảm giác mất động lực quá…

Cảm ơn những ai đã bỏ thời gian ra để đọc bài viết này của em. Chắc chắn sẽ có những người đọc xong mà thấy phát bực, em cũng hiểu được bản thân lúc đó còn quá bốc đồng…

I feel like I'm living to pay off debt. I was born into a normal family, my parents worked as manual laborers, their income was not high, but my father was addicted to gambling. Since I was a child, I lived like someone came to my house to demand money and saw my mother grit her teeth and work hard to pay off my father's gambling debt.

I advised my mother to divorce, from the time I was in middle school until I was 30 years old. When I was a child, my mother told me that if I didn't have children, I wouldn't have to suffer like this. When I grew up, I said I was old and then people would laugh at me.

When the day I went to work, my mother felt like she had found someone to share the family's burden with. I also felt relieved because I could help my mother every month with food expenses, electricity and water bills.
My father also gambles less, but...

It's my younger brother's turn to incur debt.

No one in the family knew what he borrowed for, it was just that one normal day he called his mother home and informed him that he had borrowed more than 120 million and borrowed from several banks.
A few days later, someone came to claim it, and then there were days of terrorizing my phone and text messages because maybe they put my number in the guarantor's name.

From 2022 until now, my phone has always been in silent mode, neither vibrating nor ringing because someone always calls to collect debt.

The whole family also found a way to repay his debt. During this time he did not agree at all, and while everyone including me had to work to repay the debt, he borrowed again, the amount up to 200 million.

I'm extremely stressed during this time. I go to work in the morning and still laugh and joke with my colleagues. At night, I'm stunned. Sometimes I'm so tired that I cry. I always stay up until 2-3 a.m. to sleep.

It's not that I don't look for friends to confide in, but after graduating, I see that everyone is living a new life, I'm just an unimportant part, their superficial way makes me feel it's best not to bother them.

At the end of last year, the whole family just finished paying his debt. I know he still has to borrow money because there are still people calling to remind him of the debt, but I don't care. This time he has to pay himself, but both my parents and I are already very tired.
He developed a habit of stealing again, he sneaked into my room, even though I locked the door, and stole my money and laptop to pawn. This year he pawned it a few times. My parents helped me redeem it, but when I ran out of money, he noticed and watched me go to work and steal it again. There was a time when I was so scared that I had to bring my laptop to work, but because my colleagues all asked me why I brought my laptop with me. The company already had a computer, but the laptop was heavy and kept carrying it back and forth, so I just left the laptop at home.

Just last week he took 2 million from me and pawned my laptop, then today someone came to my house to collect the debt.

He still works normally, still has an income but doesn't understand why he borrowed so much debt. The whole family has asked about it since he borrowed 200 million but he refuses to talk. Anyone who asks anything is as mute as deaf. When he comes home, he still eats and drinks as usual, but when it comes to money, he stays silent.

Both my parents and I are tired, I feel like I'm more stressed, I'm being forced into the cycle of borrowing money to pay for them, sometimes I wonder what my purpose in life is.

I had more difficulty sleeping and started thinking a lot, mostly negative thoughts.
I want to run away from home but I'm afraid my mother will have to bear all the pressure. I also have thoughts of wanting to kill my younger brother or thoughts of harming myself.

I'm even more afraid of getting married because the men who should be the ones who love and care for me the most cause the most pain and obsession. I'm afraid of living like my mother. I'm afraid of having to pay for my karma until the end of my life because people say that daughters rely on their father's blessings. I'm also afraid that when I have a child, I'll tell him: ""It's because of you that I'm suffering like this""...

Countless negative thoughts are blooming in my head, I'm really tired, I don't want to cry or complain in front of others.
But I'm really tired...","Mình mệt quá  Chào mọi người, mình (31F, độc thân) chỉ muốn trải lòng về cuộc sống của mình một chút, câu văn chắc sẽ lủng củng, mong mọi người thông cảm.

Mình cảm thấy mình đang sống để trả nợ. Mình sinh ra trong một gia đình bình thường, bố mẹ toàn làm lao động chân tay, thu nhập không cao nhưng bố mình nghiện cờ bạc. Từ ngày còn nhỏ mình đã sống theo kiểu bị hay người khác đến nhà đòi tiền và thấy mẹ mình cắn răng làm quần quật để trả nợ thay nợ cờ bạc của bố.

Mình có khuyên mẹ li dị, khuyên từ ngày mình còn học cấp 2 đến năm 30t, ngày còn bé thì mẹ bảo nếu không phải có con rồi thì mẹ chẳng phải khổ thế này, đến lúc lớn thì bảo giờ già rồi bỏ người ta cười cho.

Đến ngày mình đi làm, mẹ như tìm được người san sẻ gánh nặng gia đình cùng, mình cũng cảm thấy nhẹ lòng vì có thể phụ giúp cho mẹ mỗi tháng với chi phí ăn uống, tiền điện nước.
Bố mình cũng bớt cờ bạc hơn nhưng...

Đến lượt thằng em mình gây nợ.

Cả nhà không ai biết nó mượn nợ vì mục đích gì, chỉ là một ngày bình thường nó gọi mẹ mình về và báo đã mượn nợ hơn 120tr, mượn tín dụng mấy ngân hàng.
Vài ngày sau có người đến đòi và sau đó là chuỗi ngày khủng bố điện thoại tin nhắn của mình vì có lẽ nó điền số mình vào người đảm bảo.

Từ năm 2022 đến nay điện thoại của mình luôn ở chế độ im lặng, không rung không chuông vì luôn có người gọi đến để đòi nợ.

Cả nhà cũng tìm cách trả nợ cho nó, trong thời gian này nó không phụ đồng nào cả, và trong khi mọi người bao gồm cả mình phải làm việc để trả nợ thì nó lại vay tiếp, số tiền lên đến 200tr.

Mình bị stress kinh khủng trong thời gian này, sáng đi làm vẫn cười đùa vui vẻ với đồng nghiệp, tối về thì lại ngây người, có khi mệt mỏi quá sẽ khóc, lúc nào cũng thức đến 2-3h sáng mới ngủ.

Không phải là mình không tìm bạn bè để tâm sự đâu nhưng sau khi ra trường mình thấy ai cũng sống cuộc sống mới rồi, mình chỉ là 1 phần không quan trọng thôi, cách họ hời hợt khiến mình cảm thấy tốt nhất không nên làm phiền họ.

Cuối năm ngoái cả nhà mới trả nợ xong cho nó, mình biết nó vẫn còn mượn nợ tiếp vì vẫn có người gọi đến nhắc nợ nhưng mình mặc kệ, lần này nó phải tự trả tiền chứ cả bố mẹ và mình cũng mệt mỏi lắm rồi.
Nó lại sinh ra tật ăn cắp, nó lẻn vào phòng mình, dù đã khoá cửa và lấy trộm tiền, laptop của mình đem đi cầm. Trong năm nay nó đã cầm vài lần, bố mẹ giúp mình chuộc về là khi nào hết tiền nó lại để ý và canh mình đi làm lại trộm đi cầm cố. Có đợt mình sợ quá phải mang lap đi làm nhưng vì đồng nghiệp ai cũng hỏi tại sao lại mang lap theo, cty có máy tính sẵn mà với lap cũng nặng mà cứ mang đi mang về mãi nên thôi mình lại để lap ở nhà.

Mới tuần trước nó lại lấy của mình 2tr và mang lap mình đi cầm, rồi hôm nay lại có người đến nhà đòi nợ.

Nó vẫn đi làm bình thường, vẫn có thu nhập mà không hiểu sao lại mượn nợ nhiều đến mức này, cả nhà đã hỏi chuyện từ lúc mượn 200tr đến giờ nhưng nó không chịu nói, ai hỏi gì cũng như câm như điếc, về nhà vẫn ăn uống như thường, chỉ là nhắc đến tiền lại im.

Cả bố mẹ và mình đều mệt mỏi, mình cảm giác mình đang stress hơn, mình đang bị áp vào cái guồng mượn nợ trả tiền thay cho nó, nhiều khi mình tự hỏi rốt cuộc mục đích cuộc đời này của mình là gì.

Mình khó ngủ hơn, bắt đầu suy nghĩ vẩn vơ rất nhiều, đa số là suy nghĩ tiêu cực.
Mình muốn bỏ nhà đi nhưng mình sợ mẹ mình lại phải gánh mọi áp lực, mình còn có suy nghĩ muốn g**t em trai mình nữa hoặc suy nghĩ làm hại bản thân.

Mình lại càng sợ hãi việc kết hôn hơn vì những người đàn ông đáng ra phải là người yêu thương chăm sóc mình nhất lại gây ra nỗi đau và nỗi ám ảnh nhiều nhất, mình sợ sẽ sống như mẹ mình, mình sợ phải trả nghiệp đến cuối đời vì người ta nói con gái nhờ phước của cha. Mình cũng sợ sau này có con, chính mình sẽ nói với nó: ""tại mày mà tao mới khổ như này""...

Vô vàn suy nghĩ tiêu cực đang nảy nở trong đầu mình, mình thật sự rất mệt, mình không muốn khóc lóc hay than thở trước mặt người khác.
Nhưng mình thật sự mệt lắm rồi...","i'm tired . hello everyone , i ( 31f , single ) just want open up about my life a bit . my sentence will probably clunky . i hope everyone will understand . i feel like i'm live pay off debt . i bear into a normal family , my parent work a manual laborer , their income not high , my father addict gamble . since i a child , i live like someone come my house demand money saw my mother grit her teeth work hard pay off my father's gamble debt . i advise my mother divorce , from time i middle school until i 30 year old . when i a child , my mother tell me if i didn't have child , i wouldn't have suffer like . when i grow up , i say i old then people would laugh me . when day i go work , my mother felt like she have find someone share family's burden . i also felt relieved because i could help my mother every month food expense , electricity water bill . my father also gamble less , ... it's my young brother's turn incur debt . no one family know what he borrow , just one normal day he call his mother home inform him he have borrow more than 120 million borrow from several bank . a few day later , someone come claim , then there day terrorize my phone text message because maybe they put my number guarantor's name . from 2022 until now , my phone have always silent mode , neither vibrate nor ring because someone always call collect debt . whole family also find a way repay his debt . during time he do not agree all , while everyone include me have work repay debt , he borrow again , amount up 200 million . i'm extremely stress during time . i go work morning still laugh joke my colleague . night , i'm stun . sometimes i'm tired i cry . i always stay up until 2 - 3 a . m . sleep . it's not i don't look friend confide , after graduate , i see everyone live a new life , i'm just an unimportant part , their superficial way make me feel it's best not bother them . end last year , whole family just finish pay his debt . i know he still have borrow money because there still people call remind him debt , i don't care . time he have pay himself , both my parent i already very tired . he develop a habit steal again , he sneak into my room , even though i lock door , steal my money laptop pawn . year he pawn a few time . my parent help me redeem , when i run out money , he notice watch me go work steal again . there a time when i scared i have bring my laptop work , because my colleague all ask me why i bring my laptop me . company already have a computer , laptop heavy keep carry back forth , i just leave laptop home . just last week he take 2 million from me pawn my laptop , then today someone come my house collect debt . he still work normally , still have an income doesn't understand why he borrow much debt . whole family have ask about since he borrow 200 million he refuse talk . anyone who ask anything mute a deaf . when he come home , he still eat drink a usual , when come money , he stay silent . both my parent i tire , i feel like i'm more stressed , i'm force into cycle borrow money pay them , sometimes i wonder what my purpose life . i have more difficulty sleep start think a lot , mostly negative thought . i want run away from home i'm afraid my mother will have bear all pressure . i also have thought want kill my young brother thought harm myself . i'm even more afraid get marry because men who should one who love care me most cause most pain obsession . i'm afraid living like my mother . i'm afraid have pay my karma until end my life because people say daughter rely their father's blessing . i'm also afraid when i have a child , i'll tell him : "" it's because you i'm suffer like ""... countless negative thought bloom my head , i'm really tire , i don't want cry complain front others . i'm really tire ...",Depression
1g49vq1,1729004745.0,2024-10-15 15:05:45,"Was forced to go for a nvqs examination even though I was still in school. Hello everyone. The situation is that I seem to be being solicited for money by the pressure district commander. My case is very complicated so I want to ask everyone's opinion.

Everything started when I finished high school. I had severe tuberculosis and had to be treated for the whole year so I couldn't go to college. I reserve the passing results. After that, I was forced to go for medical examination, but because I had tuberculosis, I was exempted. They released my records into the hands of the district commander. After that, I researched the law and found out that type 4 tuberculosis is basically exempt from nvqs, 3 years later they released me, no questions asked.

I was assured that I had been in college for 3 years. I had been studying hard until this year, then suddenly the commander sent me a medical certificate. When I went there, it was said that this year the new law had changed, my type 2 tuberculosis was no longer exempt (when I went back to find out again, that was true). However, I said that I was still in college, but he kept arguing that I had already studied for 4 years, so I had to go for a second medical examination (because I had tuberculosis in the first year and didn't go to college, but it was still counted as 1 year). After the preliminary examination, I brought a student certificate clearly stating that the training program would not end until next year. But the man in the ward gave up and said that the district refused. Now he kept that student's certificate and took it to the Nvqs council to reconsider. He said that in my case, they would probably still let me study. But I'm still hesitant because the second round of examination has a high chance of being caught.

My family's economic situation has been difficult since covid so we don't have any money to share with the district commander. At first, I thought I had one more year left to work and save money to run, but the district commander made a mistake asking me to go to the doctor this year, so now I'm so scared. Does anyone have any tips to help me?","Bị bắt đi khám NVQS mặc dù vẫn đang đi học Chào mấy bác. Tình hình là em có vẻ đang bị cha chỉ huy quận áp lực vòi tiền. Trường hợp của em rất phức tạp nên muốn hỏi ý kiến mọi người.

Mọi việc bắt đầu khi em học xong cấp 3. Em bị lao phổi nặng phải điều trị nguyên năm đó nên không học ĐH được. Em bảo lưu kết quả đậu ĐH. Sau đó bị bắt đi khám nvqs nhưng vì bị lao nên được miễn, nó thả nhưng hồ sờ của em vô tay cha chỉ huy quận. Sau đó em có tìm hiểu luật thì biết bệnh lao phổi loại 4 cơ bản là miễn nvqs luôn rồi, 3 năm sau nó thả em luôn, không hỏi hang gì hết.

Em yên tâm vô học ĐH được 3 năm, học hành cày cuốc tới năm nay thì đùng 1 cái cha chỉ huy gởi giấy kt sức khoẻ nvqs. Lên đó chả kêu năm nay đổi luật mới, lao phổi của em loại 2 không còn miễn nữa (em về tìm hiểu lại thì đúng là như vậy). Tuy nhiên em có nói là vẫn còn đang học ĐH nhưng ổng cứ cãi là em đã học đủ 4 năm rồi nên phải đi khám nvqs đợt 2(vì năm đầu em bị lao phổi không học ĐH nhưng vẫn tính là 1 năm). Đợt khám sơ tuyển sau đó em có đem giấy chứng nhận SV ghi rõ là chương trình đào tạo phải năm sau mới kết thúc. Nhưng ông trên phường chịu thua kêu là trên quận nó không chịu, bây giờ giữ giấy SV đó hôm đi khám đợt 2 ổng dẫn lên Hội đồng NVQS xin xem xét lại. Ổng kêu trường hợp em chắc họ vẫn cho học thôi. Nhưng mà em vẫn rén vì lên khám đợt 2 khả năng cao dễ bị hốt.

Nhà em kinh tế khó khăn từ hồi Covid nên ko có tiền chung cha chỉ huy quận. Ban đầu em tính là còn 1 năm để đi làm dành dụm tiền để chạy, nhưng cha chỉ huy quận làm 1 pha đòi năm nay đi khám liền như vậy nên giờ em lo sợ quá.

1kz4xmn,1748613558.0,2025-05-30 13:59:18,"To own a house at this stage - what level of difficulty? 

Set in the general context - go to college in big cities, and graduate and go to work at 22 years old.  
  
Hello fellow graduates, currently prices are escalating, to the point where real estate is about to lie flat. For me between the ages of 30 - 35, and working in an environment where people have office salaries at a net level of 70 - 120 million, I find that owning a house is really difficult now.  
  
  
**problem:**  
City land/in places where you have just finished school and started working is already 40 million/m2 (apartments, considered social housing), in HCMC apartment prices fluctuate up to 55 - 80 even 130 million/m2, if we don't have a strategy we will fail immediately because of many difficulties:  
  
\- the higher the land price, the higher your salary and the higher your personal income tax.**  
  
**Our salary must be paid in priority before buying 1 square meter of land:**  
(1) reduce your family circumstances - roughly called living expenses (11 million - to have a standard of living with enough electricity, water, gas, car and car)  
**(2) personal income tax costs (the higher the land price, the higher the tax you pay, then the remaining balance can be calculated)**  
(3) raising children (must be at least 5 million/month to be considered average)  
(4) supporting elderly parents (the older the parents are, the older they become, the more they will lose income when they grow up, and their expenses will be 2 million - 5 million/month depending on conditions)  
**(5) bank loan interest expense (9%/year)**  
**and finally the principal repayment -&gt; is the payment for /m2 of land**  
=&gt; So the higher and higher the land price is, the more and more costs for number (2) and number (5), especially number (2), because the more income increases, the more taxes are paid.  
  
**advice**  
Having money to buy a house first and get married later is very difficult for a normal person, so I have the following advice:  
(1) If you can borrow and have the ability to think about profitable investments, everyone should start from the graduate stage =&gt; Borrow and invest now to earn passive income  
(2) find a wife early, or a partner early (but have children a little later), to work together and have a house together (2 sources of income, so the tax value is lower, the pressure level is reduced)  
(3) Buy within reach and wisely so you don't feel pressured to pay too much after age 32 - you won't be unemployed.  
(4) Land prices are constantly increasing, even those who work together to generate surplus cash flow to pay principal/interest and pay for their own houses are having to struggle, not to mention their children.**  
  
Everyone says why don't you just save up and buy low, but every layer of clouds has to fly to that layer so it's not easy, everyone. At this point, selling a house means you can never buy it again. **use in moderation**  
  
**If you have any advice, please leave it for discussion.**

**I don't use the app so I can't create a poll. How do you choose the difficulty level?**

* easy
* normal
* very difficult
* no hope ?","Để có nhà ở giai đoạn này - mức độ khó cấp nào? 

Lấy bối cảnh số đông là - học đại học tại các TP lớn, và ra trường đi làm năm 22 tuổi.  
  
Chào các anh/em sắp ra trường, hiện tại vật giá ngày càng leo thang, đến nỗi nhà đất đều muốn nằm thẳng. Với mình tuổi từ 30 - 35, và làm trong môi trường có những người lương văn phòng ở cấp độ net là 70 - 120tr thì thấy rằng có nhà bây giờ thực sự rất khó.  
  
  
**Vấn đề:**  
Đất thành phố/ ở những nơi anh em vừa đi học xong và vừa đi làm khởi đầu khởi điểm cũng đã là 40tr/m2 (chung cư, coi như là nhà ở xã hội đi), ở TPHCM dao động giá chung cư lên đến 55 - 80 thậm chí 130tr/m2, nếu không có chiến lược chúng ta sẽ fail ngay vì nhiều khó khăn:  
  
\- Khi giá đất càng lên cao, lương cứng anh càng phải cao và **anh phải nộp thuế thu nhập cá nhân cao lên.**  
  
**Tiền lương chúng ta trước khi mua được 1m2 đất đã phải ưu tiên thanh toán:**  
(1) Giảm trừ gia cảnh bản thân - gọi nôm na là chi phí sinh hoạt (11 triệu - để có mức sống vừa đủ điện nước xăng xe sinh hoạt)  
**(2) Chi phí thuế thu nhập cá nhân (giá đất càng cao, anh em nộp thuế càng cao, rồi dư lại mới tính tiếp được)**  
(3) Nuôi con cái (phải tối thiểu 5tr/tháng mới gọi là vừa mức bình quân)  
(4) Nuôi cha mẹ già (cha mẹ đẻ con càng già thì lúc trưởng thành thì cũng mất thu nhập, chi phí các cụ cũng đã là 2tr - 5tr/tháng tuỳ điều kiện)  
**(5) Chi phí lãi vay ngân hàng (9%/năm)**  
**VÀ CUỐI CÙNG MỚI LÀ TIỀN TRẢ NỢ GỐC -&gt; LÀ TIỀN TRẢ CHO /m2 đất**  
=&gt; Như vậy giá đất càng ngày càng cao, thì chi phí cho cái số (2) và số (5) càng ngày càng khủng, đặc biệt là cái số (2), vì thu nhập càng tăng thì đóng thuế càng tăng  
  
**Lời khuyên**  
Để có tiền mua nhà trước và lập gia đình sau là điều rất khó cho một người bình thường, do vậy mình có lời khuyên như sau:  
(1) Nếu vay được, mà có khả năng tư duy đầu tư sinh lời, mọi người nên làm từ giai đoạn mới ra trường =&gt; vay và đầu tư ngay để kiếm thu nhập thụ động  
(2) Kiếm vợ sớm, hoặc đối tác sớm (nhưng có con trễ xíu), để cùng cày và cùng có cái nhà (2 nguồn thu nhập cày, nên giá trị đóng thuế thấp hơn, mức độ áp lực giảm tải)  
(3) Hãy mua trong tầm tay và khôn ngoan để đừng bị áp lực trả quá nặng sau 32 tuổi - không khéo thất nghiệp  
(4) Giá đất không ngừng tăng cao, ngay cả những người làm chung cùng mình để **thặng dư ra dòng tiền trả gốc/lãi và trả cho căn nhà của BẢN THÂN HỌ họ cũng phải rất chật vật, chưa kể còn con họ.**  
  
Ai cũng nói sao không biết để dành mua thấp thôi, nhưng mây tầng nào cũng phải bay tầng đó cho nên không dễ dàng mọi người ạ. TẠI THỜI ĐIỂM NÀY, BÁN NHÀ LÀ MUA LẠI KHÔNG BAO GIỜ ĐƯỢC. **Xài vừa vừa thôi**

Hello mn. I'm a 25 year old male. Since graduating, I have worked at a company introduced by an acquaintance. Because this year the company restructured its departments, I was transferred to another department that was no longer in my field, so I encountered many difficulties and pressure, so I wanted to change jobs. 

Recently, my friend introduced me to a place that recruits people who don't know anything about training, the income is quite good, there are time constraints (work all night, no time off on holidays) but they have exactly the skills I've been working on before, specifically video editing.

I sent my CV to apply for an apprentice position and was accepted to the interview. As a side note, this is also the first time going to interview because before, students only went to school, and after graduation, there were people applying for jobs, so there was no stressful interview.

During the interview, the hr friend asked for some conditions such as finishing school and having to work immediately, working day and night shifts, and even on holidays, and I said yes. However, today the company sent a reply email and refused with the reason that it was inappropriate. I just texted you again like in the photo. 
In JD, the company's position requires you to have graduated from university, understand basic mechanics, be of medical age and know how to use basic software. I can meet all of these things, so being rejected is a bit disappointing. I graduated with honors from a postal school, have a TOEIC score of 750 in English, and have also created a number of videos at a number of major agencies. At my current company, since I started, there's only been one person working on the project, no one to guide me. Having to do it all by myself is a bit tiring, so I want to find a more professional environment for guidance.

Because it's the first time I'm trying to move out on my own, I don't know what to do next, so I'd like to ask you again. Is it cowardly to ask and what should I do next?

Just a little note, he's a bit shy, doesn't interact much, from childhood to adulthood his parents took care of him so he always lived in a safe zone. Now he wants to go out and grow up a bit, but he's still too young and faces a lot of difficulties. I look forward to receiving your sharing","Trượt phỏng vấn, e hỏi lại hr thế này liệu có hèn quá không ạ?

Hôm pv thì bạn hr có hỏi một số điều kiện như là học xong phải làm luôn, làm việc xoay ca ngày đêm và cả lễ tết thì e đều bảo được. Tuy nhiên hôm nay cty gửi mail trả lời thì lại từ chối với lý do là không phù hợp. E mới nhắn tin lại với bạn hr như ảnh. 
Trong jd thì cty yc vị trí học vc yêu cầu tốt nghiệp đh, hiểu TA cơ bản, trong độ tuổi yc và biết sử dụng cơ bản phần mềm dựng. Mấy cái này e đều e đáp ứng đc nên bị từ chối có hơi hụt hẫng. E tốt nghiệp loại giỏi ngành multi trường bưu chính, tiếng Anh cũng đc 750 toeic, cũng đã dựng 1 số video tại 1 số sk lớn. Ở cty hiện tại từ lúc ra trg chỉ có 1 mk e lm dựng, ko có ai hướng dẫn , đều phải tự mày mò cũng hơi mệt nên e muốn tìm một môi trường chuyên nghiệp hơn để đc hướng dẫn

Do lần đầu tự bươn trải ra ngoài nên e cũng ko biết làm gì tiếp theo nên e xin hỏi mn e hỏi lại thế này có hèn ko ạ và e nên làm gì tiếp ạ.

Note 1 chút thì là một đứa hơi nhát, ít va chạm, từ bé đến lớn đc bố mẹ bao bọc quá nên luôn sống trong vùng an toàn, bây giờ muốn ra ngoài để trưởng thành hơn chút mà còn non quá, gặp hơi nhiều khó khăn. Rất mong nhận được chia sẻ từ mn ạ

Speaking of which, I met nyc 22, we were in the same class c3 when we were 12 and were both each other's first loves. After that, we took the entrance exam to the same university in Hanoi, our house was different. The process of getting used to it is quite good, we study together and try together. After 4 years of knowing each other, you suddenly said you broke up with me because you were bored, no longer in love, said there was pressure on the future and all, ignoring all the previous promises and promises. I'm not in love anymore but you still want to be friends with me 😀 :))), at first I was nervous but after a few months I found out that you were being vague with someone new, so I blocked you immediately. I have to say that time was the worst time I've ever experienced because I felt so much for you, I didn't think you could hurt me that much.
It's been almost a year since this happened. I recently stalked your friend's nyc and nym fb. I feel inferior and compare myself to those people. Like, that other nym studied foreign languages ​​well, so he taught her to take the ie test, and then those two liked each other and when I blocked them, they joined the official channel. In nyc, I'm also very good at studying, I've achieved a lot of things, I'm diligent and progressive, and when I'm in love, I take care of you so much that I always regret it. haizzzz
Now in New York, I went to work in the province and then went to study abroad. I also just passed the job I like in Hanoi. I know there's nothing I should be sad about or compare myself to, but I just feel sad. After the wedding, I was quite quiet and soothed my hurt without posting on social media or trying to get to know anyone else. I feel like I'm drifting now and I've lost my direction.
Dear friends, can you give me more advice so that I can have a better breakthrough next time? I also want to become more mature and develop more, but I haven't found a clear motivation.

1pupl6g,1766589205.0,2025-12-24 15:13:25,"How to cut ties with a toxic family Hello everyone, if anyone has experience, please give me your advice. This post is a bit long because there are too many stories, so I hope everyone understands.



I'm stressed and feel hopeless because my parents are so toxic. Briefly, I am male, 30 years old, currently living with my wife. Previously, the relationship between my wife and my parents was quite good because my wife was understanding and didn't want any drama, so she gave in to my parents a lot even when she had to suffer.

  
Things started to become difficult when my wife and I moved away from our parents, because if we lived close, every time we came to visit, our parents would be too controlling and take strange actions such as forcing us to open the bedroom door when we sleep so that our mother can come in and out at any time, being jealous of my wife when she gives in to her or treating her to something, and then keeps insinuating that when I come home to visit, I should sleep with my mother and not with my wife. My mother often criticizes both me and my wife, even though my wife is good at studying and working to make money, and I also work hard and take care of the family, not a frivolous person. My mom even compared my wife to my nyc right in front of my wife even though nyc and I broke up a long time ago. One time my wife had a slight eye injury, I was worried about her, my mother had to cry out that oh my mother's leg hurts too so I had to go comfort her. If I didn't comfort her, my mother would get upset, so my wife told me to stop comforting her and she would be fine. After that, I compensated, but I also felt that it was too much of a disadvantage for my wife. These are just some light things, but there are many other things that I both don't remember clearly and want to forget.

Last time, both my wife and I were seriously ill, and at that time my parents kept making assumptions and comparing us to other people's children, then put pressure on us to move back to live near my parents. When my wife and I disagreed, my parents would call, text, and ask one person after another to come to our house to ""advise"" even though I had clearly stated that I did not allow anyone to come to our house. then threatened to ask someone to drag her back to her parents' house. Of course I don't agree. So my parents started saying bad things about my wife, calling her 4\`, and then gradually said bad things about my wife's parents and relatives. My parents also said that I have mental problems, my wife also divorced after a few years, and only my parents are forever. I went to a psychologist and the psychiatrist also made it clear that the problem is my parents who are going crazy because they are losing control of me, not me. I used to be weak, because I thought I owed my parents. But every day I feel more and more that my parents are too unreasonable and unreasonable. So I told my parents many times to leave us alone, but they just kept doing it more and more. 

Up to now, my parents still talk like they're paranoid, making up stories every day to separate the couple, and saying that everyone around them despises me for this and that. made up stories about giving me money and a house, even though I've lived until now, my parents haven't given me anything. No money, no house. I even left my parents to go to work early, my parents didn't even raise me until I was 18 years old. Everything I have today is because I and my wife worked on our own and my wife's family supported me a lot.

There are many more stories that I cannot write down here because they are too long. I'm just writing this so everyone can understand the situation. Now I want to cut off completely with my parents, but no matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how I explain, my parents still keep telling me to stop seeing each other, from now on we won't have anything to do with each other anymore, and then block me. But after 1 or 2 months, I open the chat and curse at her, ask questions, or pretend to talk like nothing happened.

I'm so tired and want to stop everything once and for all. But I'm also worried that my parents will hire gangsters to bother me, my wife, and especially my wife's family. My wife's family has helped me so much, I'm really embarrassed that I'm causing everyone to have to endure such anxiety. Please give me your opinion on how to completely cut off the relationship. Because if it's just me, I can simply block it. But as for my wife's relatives, my parents know everything, so they keep bothering them.","Làm thế nào để cắt đứt quan hệ với gia đình độc hại Chào mọi người, ai có kinh nghiệm rồi thì cho em xin ý kiến với ạ. Bài hơi dài vì nhiều chuyện quá nên hy vọng mọi người thông cảm.



Em đang căng thẳng và cảm thấy bế tắc vì bố mẹ quá độc hại. Sơ qua thì em là nam, 30t, hiện đang ở chung với vợ. Trước đây mối quan hệ giữa vợ em và bố mẹ khá ổn vì vợ là người hiểu chuyện và cũng k muốn drama gì nên nhường nhịn bố mẹ em rất nhiều kể cả khi vợ phải chịu thiệt.

  
Chuyện bắt đầu trở nên khó khăn khi em và vợ chuyển đi ở xa hẳn khỏi bố mẹ, vì nếu ở gần thì mỗi lần về thăm, bố mẹ em đều kiểm soát quá đà và có những hành động kì quặc như bắt bọn em phải mở cửa phòng khi ngủ để mẹ ra vào lúc nào cũng được, có thái độ ghen tị với vợ em khi em nhường vợ em hay chiều vợ em cái gì đó, rồi cứ bóng gió là đáng ra em về thăm nhà thì phải ngủ với mẹ chứ k phải ngủ với vợ. Mẹ em còn rất hay chê bai cả em và vợ em, dù vợ em học hành và đi làm kiếm tiền đều giỏi, còn em thì cũng chăm chỉ đi làm và chăm lo gia đình chứ cũng k phải dạng lông bông. Mẹ còn so sánh vợ em với nyc của em ngay trước mặt vợ em dù em và nyc đã chia tay từ lâu. Có lần vợ em bị thương nhẹ ở mắt, em lo cho vợ em, mẹ em cũng phải kêu lên là ôi mẹ cũng đang đau chân để khiến em phải sang dỗ mẹ. Nếu em không dỗ thì mẹ lại dỗi nên lúc ấy vợ cũng bảo thôi em dỗ mẹ cho xong đi còn vợ không sao. Sau đó em có bù đắp nhưng tự em cũng thấy như thế là thiệt thòi cho vợ quá nhiều. Đây chỉ là một số chuyện nhẹ nhàng thôi chứ có nhiều chuyện khác em cũng vừa không nhớ rõ vừa muốn quên đi.

Đợt trước cả em và vợ ốm nặng, mà lúc đó bố mẹ em ngày này qua ngày cứ đặt điều và so sánh bọn em với con cái nhà người khác, rồi thì gây áp lực để bọn em phải dọn về sống gần bố mẹ em. Lúc em và vợ không đồng ý thì bố mẹ em khủng bố điện thoại, nhắn tin, nhờ hết người này đến người khác đến nhà bọn em để ""khuyên bảo"" dù em đã nói rõ em không cho phép ai đến nhà. Rồi đe doạ là sẽ nhờ người đến lôi em về nhà bố mẹ. Đương nhiên em không đồng ý. Thế là bố mẹ em bắt đầu đặt điều nói xấu vợ em, gọi vợ em là 4\`, rồi dần dần nói xấu đến cả bố mẹ và họ hàng của vợ em. Bố mẹ em còn bảo tâm lí đầu óc em có vấn đề, vợ thì cũng sau mấy năm là bỏ nhau, chỉ có bố mẹ là mãi mãi. Em đã đi khám tâm lí và bác sĩ tâm lí cũng nói rõ vấn đề là ở bố mẹ đang phát điên lên vì mất kiểm soát với em chứ không phải em. Em trước đây cũng nhu nhược, vì nghĩ mình nợ bố mẹ. Nhưng càng ngày em càng cảm thấy bố mẹ em quá đáng và vô lí. Thế nên em đã nhiều lần nói bố mẹ em để cho bọn em được yên nhưng bố mẹ em chỉ càng ngày càng làm tới. 

Đến bây giờ bố mẹ em vẫn nói chuyện như hoang tưởng, ngày ngày vẫn bịa chuyện ra để li gián 2 vợ chồng, và nói rằng mọi người xung quanh khinh bỉ em này kia. Bịa chuyện là cho em tiền, cho em nhà, dù em sống đến giờ này bố mẹ em không cho em được cái gì. Tiền không, nhà cửa càng không. Em còn rời bố mẹ để đi làm sớm, bố mẹ em còn không nuôi em đến 18t. Tất cả những gì em có ngày hôm nay là do em và vợ tự thân vận động và nhà vợ hỗ trợ rất nhiều.

Còn rất nhiều chuyện nữa mà em không thể viết hết ra ở đây được vì quá dài. Em chỉ viết qua như vậy để mọi người hiểu sơ tình hình. Giờ em muốn cắt đứt hẳn với bố mẹ, nhưng dù làm thế nào, nói thế nào, giải thích thế nào, bố mẹ em vẫn cứ nhắn là thôi từ mặt nhau, từ nay k liên quan đến nhau nữa rồi chặn em. Nhưng sau 1 2 tháng lại mở chat ra lại chửi em, đặt điều, hoặc giả vờ nói chuyện như k có chuyện gì xảy ra.

Em quá mệt mỏi và muốn dừng mọi chuyện lại 1 lần và mãi mãi. Nhưng em cũng lo bố mẹ em sẽ thuê xã hội đen đến làm phiền em, vợ em, và đặc biệt là gia đình vợ em. Gia đình vợ em đã giúp đỡ em quá nhiều, em thật sự ngại vì khiến mọi người phải chịu đựng cái cảnh lo lắng như thế này. Xin mọi người cho em ý kiến, làm thế nào để cắt đứt hẳn đỡ dây dưa. Vì nếu chỉ riêng em thì đơn giản em cứ chặn là xong. Nhưng còn cả họ hàng nhà vợ em, bố mẹ em cũng biết hết nên cứ làm phiền họ hoài.

Even though I don't have much to spare, I think the current standard of living is enough for both husband and wife and 1 child. We rent a house, 8 million a month. Recently, my parents and I have been pushing to buy a house. Now that I buy a house, I have to pay the bank about 15-20 million each month, so life will become poor.

2. No longer investing in development: I'm in the auditing industry, I still have many degrees and English to learn to increase my income.

3. At the end of the month, you cut off half of your income. Many times, this pressure and that, month after month, causes too many problems to mention. If you suddenly become unemployed, it's gone.

Perhaps many people are also constrained and controlled by their parents, making themselves uncomfortable. I'm a 20 year old male, my mother still sleeps with me and I can't stay up late running ddl because my mother goes to bed at 12 o'clock. I have a lot of DDL (6-year major), participating in clubs and school union committees. So lately, work and study have been stagnant, so I feel pressured.

In addition, there are many other things, for example, in the afternoon, when my mother sees that it's time to go home but hasn't come home yet, she will call continuously (when I go to the coffee shop to run ddl, I will be called back). My classroom is in the middle of the house, I always have to open the door so people passing by know what I'm doing. I can't ride a motorbike and my dad takes me to school and takes the bus when he comes back.

Many people will say ""my parents just want to be good"" or ""my parents have to do something to lose their trust"". That's right, the two biggest mistakes are that I once lent money to my friends and on Tet, my friends invited me to play games and I got discovered (my mother is very against these two things). My parents are also over 60 so I don't want to upset them and I also try to be obedient and do a lot of housework.

Maybe I'm not mature enough and don't trust my parents enough? From childhood to adulthood, my parents preferred the style where I only worried about studying, so I did well in school. I chose a specialized school in Ho Chi Minh City. c3, I also participated in the exam and went to work. In the exam, I also passed ftu, hcmut, ueh, vin... but it wasn't too bad. I studied in the first year of hcmut, then re-took the exam and am studying a 6-year major.","Cách giải quyết khi bị kiểm soát 
Chắc có lẽ nhiều người cũng bị bố mẹ gò bó, kiểm soát khiến bản thân khó chịu. Mình nam 20t, mẹ mình vẫn ngủ chung và mình không được thức khuya chạy ddl vì mẹ mình đi ngủ lúc 12h. Mình thì kiểu rất nhiều ddl (ngành học 6 năm mà), tham gia CLB và BCH Đoàn Trường. Nên dạo này công việc và học tập bị trì trệ nên thấy áp lực.

Ngoài ra còn nhiều cái khác, VD như buổi chiều mẹ thấy tới giờ về mà chưa về thì sẽ gọi điện liên tục (mình ra cf chạy ddl sẽ bị gọi về). Phòng học mình thì ở giữa nhà, luôn phải mở cửa để mọi người đi ngang biết mình đang làm gì. Mình ko đc đi xe máy và bố mình sẽ chở mình đi học, lúc về thì đi xe buýt.

Nhiều người sẽ nói là “bố mẹ chỉ muốn tốt” hoặc là “m phải làm gì đó bố mẹ mới mất niềm tin”. Thì đúng thế, 2 lỗi lớn nhất là mình từng cho bạn bè mượn tiền với lại dịp Tết bạn bè rủ mình chơi game và mình bị phát hiện (mẹ mình bài xích 2 cái này lắm). Bố mẹ mình cũng ngoài 60 nên mình k muốn làm buồn lòng và mình cũng cố nghe lời với làm việc nhà nhiều.

Chắc mình chưa đủ trưởng thành và chưa đủ tin tưởng với bố mẹ nhỉ? Nhỏ tới lớn thì bố mẹ mình chuộng cái kiểu mình chỉ lo học nên mình học khá, trường chuyên lớp chọn ở tphcm. C3 mình cũng tham gia HĐNK và đi làm, thi ĐH thì cũng đậu FTU, HCMUT, UEH, Vin… chứ cũng đâu tệ lắm. Mình học năm đầu HCMUT xong thi lại và đang học ngành học 6 năm.

Last November, I was lucky enough to surpass more than 800 applications to receive a full exchange scholarship to Italy for students under 18 years old. hehe I was very happy, because it was the first time I applied for a non-governmental organization by myself, wrote my own essay, practiced interviewing by myself, the first time I participated in an interview entirely in English,... the first time I met people from the north to the south who passed scholarships, the first time I participated in an offline meeting and spoke English 24/24, in general, many firsts. I also consider this scholarship as the first milestone on my path to study abroad for university in the future. Everything seems very good and open.

From January 2025, I started preparing for an exchange year. I made a lot of plans for a year in Italy, from studying, taking certificate exams, preparing documents to study abroad at university level, making friends, traveling, taking photos and films to record memories,...

By April 2025, I realized that my host family, host dad and host mom are very respectful of people, love Vietnamese cuisine, love animals and often say words of encouragement to me whenever I feel sad and confide in them. They even bought a cat for me over there because they were afraid that I would miss my kitten when I was away from Vietnam for a year. Well, reading this, everyone can see that my one-year life in Italy is very good, right? Why do I have to write the headline ""giving up full scholarship""!

sigh but God's calculation is not as good as man's calculation. I don't ask to be reserved from school —&gt; Can't get a visa —&gt; can't go. That's it, that's the reason, because this is only an exchange scholarship for one year so I need to apply for a reservation, one year later I can return to Vietnam to continue studying, but because of the regulations in the education law: there is no concept of reservation for high school students, so I cannot apply for a reservation. If you want, you have to quit school completely and return to Vietnam after a year to study wherever you want. Surely everyone will think: if you want to go like that, then just stop, right? Yes, I also think so, but the problem is that I'm studying at a specialized school. Whether it's more or less, students from specialized schools still have priority in admission to domestic and foreign universities, and because I've also studied 11/12 in Vietnam, my family wants me to study and graduate completely, probably in Vietnam, so they don't agree to let me make that change. I'm so greedy :)))

It's been almost two months since I was officially informed that I couldn't go to Italy. The first few days were very sad, I cried up and down, disappointed and depressed because before that I had hoped and made a lot of plans and plans for this year of exchange. In this year's batch, there was only one student who couldn't go. The day my friends packed their suitcases to the airport, I looked sad, right on the first day of school :))) I felt like I was betrayed by the school, even though I knew this was my fault and fate :)))

Now things have calmed down somewhat, I'm still sad but it's less, because I still have to focus on studying, studying for university exams as well as taking the certification exams that I planned to complete in one year of going to Italy and one year of returning to Vietnam to continue studying, a bit of a plan 🔥me and host dad, host mom still keep in touch with each other and regularly update life, the two of them are also very sad and question the regulations of the Ministry of Education in Vietnam.

After knowing I couldn't go, I asked a few people and found out that the schools quite disliked students going on exchanges like this, why? Isn't it currently a period of integration and internationalization? Everyone, please share your thoughts. I hope that the Ministry of Education will adjust these regulations to be more open, creating conditions for Vietnamese students to go to the outside world.

I've written for a long time, but suddenly I'm so sad, so I confided a little, wishing everyone a happy and productive new week.","Say bye to my full scholarship Xin chào mọi người, em mới tải lại Reddit sau một thời gian (cho là) rất lâu. Em xin phép xưng “em” cho dễ viết bài nha 🫰

Tháng 11 năm ngoái, em may mắn vượt qua hơn 800 hồ sơ để nhận được học bổng trao đổi toàn phần đi Ý dành cho học sinh dưới 18 tuổi. Hehe em vui lắm, vì đấy là lần đầu tiên em tự apply cho một tổ chức phi chính phủ, tự viết luận, tự luyện phỏng vấn, lần đầu tiên em tham gia buổi phỏng vấn hoàn toàn bằng tiếng Anh,… lần đầu tiên em được gặp các bạn từ Bắc chí Nam đỗ học bổng, lần đầu tiên em tham gia offline meeting và nói tiếng Anh 24/24, nói chung là rất nhiều lần đầu tiên. Em cũng coi học bổng này như lần dấu mốc đầu tiên trên con đường du học cho bậc đại học sau này, mọi thứ dường như rất tốt đẹp và rộng mở

Từ tháng 1/2025, em bắt đầu chuẩn bị cho một năm trao đổi, em đã lên rất nhiều kế hoạch cho một năm bên Ý, từ chuyện học tập, thi các chứng chỉ, chuẩn bị hồ sơ du học ở bậc đại học, kết bạn, du lịch, chụp ảnh film ghi lại kỉ niệm,…..

Đến tháng 4/2025, em nhận host family, host dad và host mom của em rất quý người, yêu ẩm thực Việt Nam, yêu động vật và hay nói lời động viên em mỗi khi em cảm thấy buồn và tâm sự với hai bác. Thậm chí hai bác còn mua cả một bé mèo cho em ở bên kia vì sợ em sẽ nhớ con mồn lèo của em khi xa Việt Nam 1 năm. Đó, đọc đến đây mọi người thấy cuộc sống một năm bên Ý của em rất tốt đúng k, mắc quần què gì em phải ghi tiêu đề giật tít “Từ bỏ học bổng toàn phần”!

Haiz nhưng mà trời tính không bằng người tính. Em không xin được bảo lưu từ trường —&gt; không làm được visa —&gt; không đi được. Vậy đó, lí do là vậy, vì đây chỉ là học bổng trao đổi trong một năm nên em cần xin bảo lưu, một năm sau về Việt Nam còn học tiếp chứ ạ, nhưng vì những quy định trong luật giáo dục: không có khái niệm bảo lưu cho học sinh cấp 3, nên em không thể xin bảo lưu. Nếu muốn, em phải nghỉ học hẳn, sau một năm về lại Việt Nam mún học đâu thì học. Chắc chắn mọi người sẽ nghĩ: nếu đã muốn đi như vậy rồi thì cứ nghỉ đi đúng k ạ. Đúng vậy, em cũng nghĩ như thế, nhưng ngặt nghèo cái là em đang học trường chuyên, dù ít hay nhiều thì học sinh trường chuyên vẫn được ưu tiên xét tuyển đại học trong nước và cả nước ngoài, và do em cũng đã học 11/12 ở Việt Nam rồi, gia đình muốn em học và tốt nghiệp trọn vẹn, chắc cú ở VN nên không đồng ý để em đánh đổi như vậy. Em tham lam quá:)))

Cũng đã gần hai tháng em chính thức được thông báo mình không thể đi Ý, mấy ngày đầu buồn lắm, khóc lên khóc xuống, thất vọng và suy sụp vì trước đó bản thân mình hy vọng và lên rất nhiều kế hoạch, dự định cho một năm trao đổi này. Cả lứa năm nay có mỗi em k đi được thui, ngày các bạn xách vali ra sân bay em nhìn mà buồn thiu, đúng hôm khai giảng nữa:))) Cảm giác như em bị trường phản bội vậy, dù em biết đây là lỗi do em và do số phận:)))

Đến giờ thì mọi thứ phần nào đã nguôi ngoai, em vẫn còn buồn nhưng bớt rùi ạ, vì em còn phải tập trung học, ôn thi ĐH cũng như thi nốt các chứng chỉ mà em lên kế hoạch hoàn thành trong một năm đi Ý và một năm quay về VN học tiếp, hơi cháy kế hoạch tí 🔥Em và host dad, host mom vẫn giữ liên lạc với nhau và thường xuyên cập nhật cuộc sống, hai bác cũng rất buồn và hỏi chấm với quy định của bộ giáo dục tại Việt Nam

Sau khi biết mình không đi được, em có hỏi một vài người và cũng biết rằng các trường khá là k thích việc học sinh đi trao đổi như này, tại sao nhỉ? Chẳng phải hiện tại đang là thời kì hội nhập, quốc tế hoá sao, mọi người hãy chia sẻ suy nghĩ nhe. Em mong rằng bộ giáo dục sẽ điều chỉnh những quy định này mở hơn, tạo điều kiện cho học sinh Việt Nam đi ra thế giới bên ngoài

Briefly speaking about myself, I am a person who loves to work, has no bad habits (doesn't stick to walls) and has a goal to pursue for many years since I was in 12th grade and has never changed.

I came from nothing, had to beg for food from charity, and slept on the streets during the days when I had no money and no conditions at home.

My job has had some big turning points and at those times, I always trust my intuition to make decisions.

I started with a pretty good job when I first graduated (salary \~ 18 million, ten years ago), then I changed to a low-paying job but with more opportunities in logistics (salary 4 million) and my first girlfriend objected to that decision, a short time later I proactively broke up (I later found out that my girlfriend was also going on dates with other people at that time).

The period after that was very hard and arduous, but it went as I planned and I encountered a number of opportunities to earn some decent money, especially during the covid period.

Later, when I left the logistics industry, I returned to my first job, became a little more stable, got married, and had my first child.

When I was about to get married, I missed an opportunity that I had been aiming for many years ago.

And then it came back. I told my wife but she didn't agree, because now I have a good job, no debt, a house and land and a few small shops to do business, my wife doesn't want to take risks, and wants to save her assets for her son.

I have been pondering over the past 6 months and have decided to divorce and leave all my assets and store (\~14 billion) to my wife and son (1 year old) to pursue my dream. I don't need anything.

If I fail, I won't affect her or my son (because this could be another 10 years of my life with a lot of risks).

If the project is successful, except for money (of course), I will also achieve the greatest pursuit of my life.

Just saying a few thoughts in my heart.

edit: Many people say why we have to break up, we need to raise a large amount of cash to implement the first phase of the project, and need to sell assets. The project was quite risky and unprofitable in the beginning, so my wife did not agree, wanting to preserve assets for their children. I see that my wife's point of view is not wrong, but I feel that she is not the right person to accompany me, so I left and left the property to my wife and son (the property is my apology, I don't need to divide it into anything). I also have friends at the investment fund and they have agreed to invest 200k in the early stages. Working with the fund requires being influenced, influenced and signing more commitments.

This post is not to raise capital or ask for advice, I just want to express my thoughts somewhere on this internet, before starting a new journey.","Lựa chọn khó khăn của cuộc đời Trong đời người đôi khi người ta đứng trước nhiều ngã rẻ mà bản thân luôn đắn đo về cái giá phải đánh đổi.

Nói sơ về mình thì mình là một người rất thích làm việc, cũng ko có tật xấu gì (ko dính tứ đổ tường) và có 1 mục tiêu để theo đuổi trong nhiêù năm từ khi mình học lớp 12 và chưa bao h thay đổi.

Mình đi lên từ bàn tay trắng, từng phải xin cơm từ thiện để ăn, và ngủ ngoài đường những ngày không có tiền, nhà cũng ko có điều kiện gì.

Công việc của mình có vài bước ngoặt lớn và ở những thời điểm đó, mình luôn tin tưởng vào trực giác của mình để đưa ra quyết định.

Mình khởi đầu với 1 công việc khá ổn khi mới ra trường tầm (lương thưởng \~ 18tr, chục năm trước), sau đó mình đổi qua một công việc lương thấp nhưng có nhiều cơ hội hơn bên Logistic (lương 4tr1) và bạn gái đầu tiên của mình phản đối về quyết định đó, một thời gian ngắn sau đó thì mình chủ động chia tay (sau này mình mới biết bạn gái cũng có đi date với ng khác ở thời điểm đó)

Khoảng thời gian sau đó thì rất vất vả và cực nhọc, nhưng nó diễn ra cũng như mình dự định và mình đã gặp một số cơ hội để kiếm được vài khoản kha khá, nhất là đợt covid.

Sau này khi rời mảng Logistic thì mình về lại công việc đầu, ổn định hơn chút và kết hôn, có con đầu lòng.

Lúc mình sắp kết hôn mình đã 1 bỏ qua cơ hội mà mình đã nhắm tới từ nhiều năm trước.

Và h thì nó quay trở lại, mình có nói với vợ mình thì vợ không đồng ý, vì hiện tại mình có công việc tốt, không nợ nần, có nhà cửa đất đai và vài cửa hàng nhỏ để kinh doanh, vợ mình không muốn rủi ro, và muốn để dành tài sản cho con trai.

Mình đã đắn đo suy nghĩ trong hơn 6 tháng qua và mình quyết định là ly hôn và để lại toàn bộ tài sản và cửa hàng (\~14 tỷ) cho vợ và con trai (1 tuổi) để theo đuổi ước mơ của mình. Mình ko cần gì cả.

Nếu thất bại thì mình sẽ không ảnh hưởng cô ấy và con trai (vì đây có thể lại là 10 năm khác của cuộc đời mình với rất nhiều rủi ro)

Nếu dự án thành công thì ngoại trừ tiền (tất nhiên) thì mình cũng đạt được theo đuổi lớn nhất của đời mình.

Chỉ nói ra vài suy nghĩ trong lòng mình.

Edit: có nhiều bạn nói tại sao phải chia tay, thì mình cần huy động 1 lượng tiền mặt lớn để triển khai dự án giai đoạn đầu, và cần bán tài sản. Dự án khá rủi ro và không có lợi nhuận trong thời gian đầu nên vợ mình không đồng ý, muốn bảo toàn tài sản cho con. Mình thấy quan điểm của vợ cũng không sai nhưng cảm thấy vợ cũng không phải là người phù hợp để đồng hành cùng mình nên mình mới rời đi để lại tài sản cho vợ và con trai (tài sản là lời xin lỗi của mình, mình không cần chia làm gì). Mình cũng có bạn ở quỹ đầu tư và người ta đã đồng ý rót vốn 200k ở giai đoạn đầu rồi, làm việc với quỹ thì phải chịu chi phối, tác động và ký kết nhiều cam kết hơn.

Bài post này không phải để gọi vốn hay nhờ tư vấn, mình chỉ muốn nói ra suy nghĩ của mình ở đâu đó trên cõi mạng này thôi, trước khi bắt đầu một hành trình mới.","life's difficult choice , people sometimes face many difficult choice always hesitate about price they have trade . briefly speak about myself , i a person who love work , have no bad habit ( doesn't stick wall ) have a goal pursue many year since i 12th grade have never change . i come from nothing , have beg food from charity , sleep street during day when i have no money no condition home . my job have have some big turning point those time , i always trust my intuition make decision . i start a pretty good job when i first graduate ( salary \~ 18 million , ten year ago ), then i change a low - pay job more opportunity logistics ( salary 4 million ) my first girlfriend object decision , a short time later i proactively break up ( i later find out my girlfriend also go date other people time ). period after very hard arduous , go a i plan i encounter a number opportunity earn some decent money , especially during covid period . later , when i leave logistics industry , i return my first job , become a little more stable , get marry , have my first child . when i about get married , i miss an opportunity i have aim many year ago . then come back . i tell my wife she didn't agree , because now i have a good job , no debt , a house land a few small shop do business , my wife doesn't want take risk , want save her asset her son . i have ponder over past 6 month have decide divorce leave all my asset store (\~ 14 billion ) my wife son ( 1 year old ) pursue my dream . i don't need anything . if i fail , i won't affect her my son ( because could another 10 year my life a lot risk ). if project successful , except money ( course ), i will also achieve great pursuit my life . just say a few thought my heart . edit : many people say why we have break up , we need raise a large amount cash implement first phase project , need sell asset . project quite risky unprofitable beginning , my wife do not agree , want preserve asset their child . i see my wife's point view not wrong , i feel she not right person accompany me , i left leave property my wife son ( property my apology , i don't need divide into anything ). i also have friend investment fund they have agree invest 200k early stage . work fund require influence , influence sign more commitment . post not raise capital ask advice , i just want express my thought somewhere internet , before start a new journey .",Depression

I was lucky to get into high school at a school in Hanoi city. That year of admission, if I didn't pass, I would have gone back to my hometown to study, but I passed. When I entered school, I was criticized for being ugly and teased by a group of girls whose families were all from Hanoi. When I went to college, I went to the same school as a girl in that group. When that girl saw that, she called on everyone to boycott her, posted her on social networks for middle school, high school, and university to see, and posted her phone number and home address in Hanoi, turning her life upside down. I dropped out of that university. Returned home for a gap year to study for the exam again to pass another school.

There was a time when I walked around the university campus and was secretly filmed and teased. I felt scared so I left and went back to my hometown. My parents also knew and went to the police to investigate this behavior, but they hid the posts attacking me so the police couldn't do anything. I was tired so I let it go, but from now on I won't go to Hanoi anymore, I'll just stay in my hometown to work and study.

I honestly don't know where to start from now. I am a 2nd year student, studying at a quite famous school in Hanoi. On the outside, I'm just like any other student: going to school, going out. But deep inside, I'm stuck in a puddle that I created myself

I started getting involved in it in 11th grade. At that time, I was still young, eager for fun, and even a few hundred thousand felt ""exciting"". Then when I went to college, far away from my family's control, I bowed deeper. In my first year, I took the car and changed my phone countless times. then reported to his family. At that time, I was truly happy, but my happiness only lasted... a few weeks. After that, I threw myself into CBM again, even harder than before.

Borrowing from friends is not allowed. I borrow apps, borrow credit, and rotate people. I had no choice but to take care of my family, gave up studying for the final exam and returned to my hometown to work as a night shift worker, hoping to repay my debt. but it's not what I thought. Because of my ignorance, because I was too blind, I lost nearly 500 million in fire. By the time I read these lines, I still feel like I'm stupid, foolish, and terribly blameworthy

I've made my parents suffer too much, but they're still dragging me down one more time. But... I did it again. After being rescued, just two months after going to Hanoi to retake the course, I played CBM again. I discussed one more car, then bowed again. Now I live about 20 million, and I no longer know how to face myself.

I feel like a failure. No matter how many promises I made, my fortune, acupuncture, and practice were all just words in the wind. I made the same mistake over and over again, like I couldn't control myself anymore. cbm only serves my dignity

At this point, I really don't know what I should do. Which direction should I go? I only saw one, I felt so guilty, so ashamed that I didn't dare look at my mother's face.

My family often has the habit of storing a few bottles of olive oil under the kitchen cabinet, but last week when I got home, I opened the cabinet and saw that the refrigerator was empty and there were no extras like usual. When I saw that, I felt like I was stupid and ruined the family, but my parents and siblings still treated me normally and they still forgave me for many mistakes I made. I made a lot of mistakes and made a lot of mistakes, but they still ignored me and forgave me. Even though I still have a bow now, I promise myself that I will correct my mistakes and live a meaningful life trying to study so that I don't make it seem like my mother and everyone have to worry about me anymore. I hope everyone who is facing the same situation as me will have the courage to overcome it.","CBM phá hủy cuộc sống sinh viên của tôi Xin chào mọi người,

Thật sự đến giờ phút này tôi không biết nên bát đầu từ đâu. Tôi là một sinh viên năm 2, học ở một trường cũng khá có tiếng ở Hà Nội. Nhìn bề ngoài thì tôi cũng giống như bao đứa sinh viên khác: đi học, đi chơi. Nhưng sâu bên trong, tôi đang mát kẹt trong một vũng lày mà chính tôi tạo ra CBM

Tôi bắt đầu đính vào nó từ lớp 11. Khi đó còn nhỏ, ham vui, vài trăm nghìn cũng thấy ""kích thích"". Rồi lên đại học, xa vòng kiểm soát của gia đình, tôi bái đầu chìm sâu hơn. Năm nhất tôi đã cầm xe, đổi điện thoại không biết bao nhiêu lần. Nọ rồi lại báo gia đình. Lúc ấy tôi có hồi hân thật, nhưng cái hồi hân của tôi chỉ kéo dài được... vài tuần. Sau đó tôi lại lao đầu vào CBM, còn mạnh hơn lần trước.

Vay bạn bè không được thị tôi vay app, vay tin dụng, xoay vòng ng. Tôi một môi quả nên trồn gia đình, bỏ cả ôn thi cuối kỳ đề về quê làm công nhân ca đêm, mong trà được nợ. Nhưng đôi không như tôi nghĩ. Vì ngu dốt, vì quá mù quáng, tôi bị lửa mát gần 500 triệu. Đến lúc gồ những dòng này, tôi vẫn thấy bản thân vừa ngụ, vừa dại, vừa đáng trách kinh khủng

Tôi làm khổ bố mẹ mình quá nhiều rồi, vậy mà họ vẫn đang tay kéo tôi dây thêm một lần nữa. Thế nhưng... tôi lại tái phạm. Sau khi được cứu, chỉ hai tháng lên Hà Nội học lại, tôi lại chơi CBM. Tôi bàn thêm một cái xe nữa, rồi lại nơ. Giờ đây tôi ng khoảng 20 triệu, và tôi không còn biết phải đối diện với chính mình thể hào.

Tôi cảm thấy mình như một kẻ thất bại. Bao nhiêu lời hứa tôi lừng bó cơ bạc, châm học, tu chỉ cuối cũng chỉ là lời nói gió bay. Tôi lập đi lập lại cùngTôi lập đi lặp lại cùng một sai lầm, giống như không còn kiểm soát nổi bản thân nữa. CBM chỉ phục vụ cái sĩ diện của tôi

Đến lúc này, tôi thật sự không biết mình nên làm gì. nên đi hướng nào. Tôi chỉ thấy một, thấy tội lỗi, thấy xấu hổ đến mức không dám nhìn mặt bỏ mẹ.

Gia đình tôi hay có thói quen tích trữ vài chai dầu ân dưới tủ bếp nhưng tuần trước khi về nhà tôi mở tủ ra thấy trống trơn tủ lạnh cũng không có đồ dự trừ như bình thường nhìn thấy vậy tôi cảm thấy bản trần thật ngu dốt, phá tan gia đình nhưng bố mẹ vă em vẫn đối xử vẫn bình thường với tối họ vẫn tha thứ cho bao nhiêu lỗi làm mà tôi gây ra. Tôi đã sai làm rất nhiều, dồi trà rất nhiều nhưng họ vẫn bỏ qua và tha thứ cho tôi. Bây giờ tuy còn nơ nhưng tôi tự hứa với bản thân rằng tôi sẽ sửa sai và sống một cuộc đời có ý nghĩa cổ gắng học hành để không làm bộ mẹ và mọi người phải lo về mình nữa. Mong mọi người ai cũng đang gặp phải trường hợp như tôi sẽ có bản lĩnh để vượt qua.","cbm destroy my student life hello everyone , i honestly don't know where start from now . i a 2nd year student , study a quite famous school hanoi . outside , i'm just like any other student : go school , go out . deep inside , i'm stick a puddle i create myself i start get involve 11th grade . time , i still young , eager fun , even a few hundred thousand felt "" excite "". then when i go college , far away from my family's control , i bow deep . my first year , i take car change my phone countless time . then report his family . time , i truly happy , my happiness only last ... a few week . after , i throw myself into cbm again , even hard than before . borrow from friend not allow . i borrow apps , borrow credit , rotate people . i have no choice take care my family , give up study final exam return my hometown work a a night shift worker , hop repay my debt . it's not what i think . because my ignorance , because i too blind , i lose nearly 500 million fire . time i read these line , i still feel like i'm stupid , foolish , terribly blameworthy i've make my parent suffer too much , they're still drag me down one more time . ... i do again . after rescue , just two month after go hanoi retake course , i play cbm again . i discuss one more car , then bow again . now i live about 20 million , i no longer know how face myself . i feel like a failure . no matter how many promise i make , my fortune , acupuncture , practice all just word wind . i make same mistake over over again , like i couldn't control myself anymore . cbm only serve my dignity point , i really don't know what i should do . which direction should i go ? i only saw one , i felt guilty , ashamed i didn't dare look my mother's face . my family often have habit store a few bottle olive oil under kitchen cabinet , last week when i get home , i open cabinet saw refrigerator empty there no extra like usual . when i saw , i felt like i stupid ruin family , my parent sibling still treat me normally they still forgive me many mistake i make . i make a lot mistake make a lot mistake , they still ignore me forgive me . even though i still have a bow now , i promise myself i will correct my mistake live a meaningful life try study i don't make seem like my mother everyone have worry about me anymore . i hope everyone who face same situation a me will have courage overcome .",Depression

I'm 21 years old, 2k4, let me ask you guys a silly question: If you graduated late, did everyone feel pressured or something before? Did that feeling gradually disappear? The situation is that I will fail the exam and likely graduate late, or even 2 years late compared to my peers. I feel quite pressured.

The reasons are both subjective and objective. Objectively, it's very confusing: the school organizes the courses a bit haphazardly, then mental health, then home economics,... but subjectively it's still due to my own negligence in studying, so I can't blame anyone. Over the past period of time, it can be said that there has been progress compared to the first year, but I have not tried hard or been lazy, so I am only now starting to feel the consequences.

I know this won't be a problem many years later, but I still feel quite a bit of peer pressure. I would like to ask for tips to overcome it or for motivation from everyone's real life situations (I haven't used social media for nearly 2 months, only occasionally go to reddit and zalo but still feel pressured).

Nguyên do thì cũng chủ quan và khách quan.

I am a 2nd year student, majoring in mechanical engineering at spkt school. According to next year's program, I will have to work in groups for about 3-4 subjects and I want to become a group leader to achieve high results with the group, while also developing teamwork skills and preparing for a beautiful CV in the future.

That's the summary, I hope that working or senior students can share their experiences on project management in teams. Specifically as follows:

1.        How do you kick off a project?

2.        In your opinion, are websites and charts too important for project management, or do we just need to focus on allocating plans and then just follow up - no need for too many charts?

3.        In case a group has members who are 4th year students, how should you behave tactfully so that the group can achieve good results together?

4.        If you have experience in project management, let me ask: when you return to being a student, with the above extensive experience, how will you manage?

The important reason why I decided to become a leader and ask the above questions is mainly because I joined many groups in year 1. Most of the students were superficial, did not work clearly, and were pushy. The peak was a group of 5 people, but 2 of them did nothing. At the end of the semester, those 2 of them begged and were afraid of failing the exam, so we had to agree to give them 100% progress so that they could have a passing score in the subject (membership is assigned by the teacher, we have no rights in this subject).

Em là sinh viên năm 2, ngành Cơ khí của trường SPKT. Theo chương trình học năm sau, em sẽ phải làm việc nhóm khoảng 3-4 môn và em muốn thành leader của nhóm để cùng nhóm đạt kết quả cao, đồng thời là kỹ năng teamwork và chuẩn bị cho CV đẹp sau này.

Tóm tắt là vậy, em mong được các anh/chị đang đi làm hoặc sinh viên năm trên chia sẻ kinh nghiệm về quản lý dự án trong đội nhóm. Cụ thể như sau:

1.        Cách anh/chị khởi động dự án (kick off) là như thế nào ạ?

2.        Theo anh/chị thì các website, biểu đồ có quá quan trọng đến quản lý dự án, hay chỉ cần tập trung phân bổ kế hoạch rồi cứ follow up thôi – không cần phải quá nhiều biểu đồ?

3.        Trường hợp mà nhóm có thành viên là sinh viên năm 4, thì anh/chị phải ứng xử như thế nào cho khéo léo để nhóm cùng nhau đạt kết quả tốt.

4.        Nếu anh/chị có kinh nghiệm quản lý dự án, cho em xin phép hỏi: khi anh/chị trở về sinh viên thì với kinh nghiệm dày dặn trên, anh/chị sẽ quản lý như thế nào ạ?

Lý do quan trọng mà em quyết định làm leader và hỏi các câu hỏi trên, chủ yếu là em đã ghép chung nhiều nhóm hồi năm 1. Hầu hết các bạn đều hời hợt, làm việc không rõ ràng, và đùn đẩy. Trong đó đỉnh điểm là nhóm 5 người nhưng có 2 bạn lại không làm gì, đến cuối kì thì 2 bạn đó năn nỉ và sợ bị rớt môn nên tụi em phải đồng ý cho bạn 100% tiến độ để bạn có điểm qua môn (thành viên là do GV phân bổ, tụi em không có quyền trong môn này).

Mainly, I'm wondering, in addition to the above differences, it's also about the training programs of the two schools. uah, it seems like studying is more about aesthetics, doing a lot &amp; variety of thesis while bku side is more about logical thinking, less thesis work. And to be honest, I'm not very passionate about landscape architecture, although it seems that in the future, when Ho Chi Minh City becomes more urban, there will be a great need for human resources in this field. I hope I can get feedback from my brothers and sisters and seniors in this ""mess"" :)). I thank you.","Xin ý kiến chọn trường đại học. Dạ tình hình là bằng học bạ trường chuyên thì em đã xét đậu xét tuyển sớm 2 trường, và em không biết chọn cái nào cho hợp lí.
Em thích kiến trúc, và tất nhiên là có ôn luyện vẽ kĩ nhưng không may rớt ngành kiến trúc và đậu ngành kiến trúc cảnh quan bên UAH (trường Đại học Kiến trúc TpHCM), nhưng có đậu ngành kiến trúc bên BKU (trường Đại học Bách Khoa TpHCM)
Thì giờ em phân giữa 2 lựa chọn
1. Học song bằng cảnh quan &amp; kiến trúc bên UAH. - Học phí cỡ 16tr/ học kì cho cả 2 môn (trung bình 1 môn 8tr/ học kì.
- Việc học song bằng được phép từ hk1 năm 2. Tốt nghiệp 2 bằng chính quy cảnh quan &amp; kiến trúc.
- Thời gian cỡ 7-8 năm (học chính quy 1 ngành là 5 năm)
2. Học kiến trúc ở BKU.
- Học phí 15tr/ học kì
- Thời gian 4 năm.
Chủ yếu là em phân vân ngoài các yếu tố chênh lệch trên còn là về chương trình đào tạo của 2 trường. UAH thì có vẻ học thiên về thẩm mĩ nhiều hơn, làm nhiều &amp; đa dạng các đồ án trong khi bên BKU thiên về tư duy logic, ít làm đồ án hơn. Và thú thật là em cũng không mê lắm về ngành kiến trúc cảnh quan, dù có vẻ như sau này khi mà TpHCM phát triển hơn về mặt đô thị sẽ rất cần nhân lực ngành này. Em hi vọng có thể có ý kiến góp ý của các anh chị, các tiền bối trong cái “mớ lằng nhằng” này :)). Em xin cảm mơn.

As for background, I'm currently a final year law student, and have had internship experience at a law office. Then, because of work, I intend to go to a business + my direct supervisor is about to quit, so I'm going to talk elsewhere. I got 2 satisfactory positions but in 2 different areas: c&amp;b and regulatory (I also don't know how TV translates, the CV is basically about compliance with chemical labeling regulations). I pv these 2 places 1 week apart, received the offer from C&amp;b first because the previous pv + only had 1 round. At that time, I also expected more regulation, but for many reasons (for example, fear of failing), I chose c&amp;b to be safe.

c&amp;b then strengths &amp; weak as follows:
Strengths:
- Good benefits, foreign company so company culture is comfortable, work from 9:00 am to 9:30 am and the team still has no one, wfh 2 days a week. If you complete the internship, you have a high chance of becoming official. CV is also good, received enthusiastically.
Weakness: I have no interest in CV. 
- The company is an HR service provider, my department works like talentnet, signing labor contracts and then assigning them to 3rd party companies. Therefore, the company should be half administrative (making reasonable costs, signing labor contracts), half human resources (payroll, social insurance, etc.). Even though I've only worked for 1 week, I already feel that the overall resume will be repetitive, and there will be almost no professional use, so I'm a bit bored.

However, I just received an offer from regulatory (also a foreign company). This side is as follows:
Strengths:
- CV matches your interests, higher benefits, the department only has 1 person and you will work directly with that person so you will learn a lot about this field. 
Weakness:
- CV will be very heavy, working time is only 3 months so there is only 1 short opportunity to prove ability, not sure about the ability to officially move up after graduation.

Should I continue working at c&amp;b or should I prioritize a CV that interests me? Thank you.","Tư vấn về thực tập E chào các anh chị ạ. Em lên đây để tham khảo ý kiến của mọi người về 2 offer thực tập khác nhau.

Background thì em hiện đang sv năm cuối ngành Luật, đã có kinh nghiệm thực tập ở 1 vp luật, sau đó vì việc quá bào, e có định hướng đi doanh nghiệp + người HD trực tiếp của e sắp nghỉ nên e cũng pv chỗ khác. E pv được 2 chỗ ưng ý nhưng về 2 mảng khác nhau: C&amp;B và regulatory (e cũng kh biết TV dịch như nào, cơ bản cv về tuân thủ quy định dán nhãn hóa chất). E pv 2 chỗ này cách nhau 1 tuần, nhận đc offer của C&amp;B trước vì pv trước + chỉ có 1 vòng. Lúc đấy e cũng đã mong chờ regulatory hơn r, nhma do nhiều lí do (ví dụ như sợ rớt) nên e chọn C&amp;B cho chắc ăn.

C&amp;B thì điểm mạnh &amp; yếu như sau:
Điểm mạnh:
- Trợ cấp ổn, cty nước ngoài nên văn hóa cty thoải mái, 9h làm 9h30 đến team vẫn chưa có ai, wfh 2 ngày 1 tuần. Nếu e làm hết kì thực tập thì có khả năng cao lên chính thức. CV cũng bth, đc hd tận tình.
Điểm yếu: e kh có hứng thú vs cv. 
- cty là bên cung cấp dịch vụ HR, bộ phận e làm giống như Talentnet, đứng ra kí hợp đồng lao động rồi chỉ định họ vào các cty bên thứ 3. Cv bởi vậy nên là 1 nửa hành chính (làm chi phí hợp lý, trình kí hđlđ), 1 nửa nhân sự (bảng lương, bhxh các thứ). Dù chỉ làm đc 1 tuần nhma e đã cảm thấy tổng thể cv sẽ lập đi lập lại, và hầu như kh sd chuyên môn nên e hơi chán.

Tuy nhiên thì e cũng mới nhận đc offer bên regulatory (cũng là cty nước ngoài). Bên này thì như sau:
Điểm mạnh:
- Cv đúng sở thích, trợ cấp cao hơn, bộ phận chỉ có 1 ng và e sẽ làm việc trực tiếp vs ng đó nên sẽ học đc rất nhiều về mảng này. 
Điểm yếu:
- CV sẽ rất nặng, thời gian làm chỉ có 3 tháng nên chỉ có 1 cơ hội ngắn để chứng tỏ năng lực, kh chắc chắn về khả năng lên chính thức sau ra trường.

Em nên tiếp tục làm ở C&amp;B hay ưu tiên cv đúng hứng thú ạ?

The thing is that from the first year until now I've been quite lazy so I go to school very little. As a result, in group subjects I will always be grouped with a girl (let's call it n). ok, the main thing is that he doesn't have any knowledge or mental ability. I know that a person like me who hasn't gone to school fully has no right to say that, but from the first year until now, there have been a total of 4 theses that I paired with n and took care of them all. She doesn't do anything and doesn't cooperate at all. I divide the work and she doesn't see or respond. She takes her pussy out with guys and plays all day or does whatever I don't care about, but she doesn't study fr. So in the end, I soloed all 4 theses and luckily passed them all. It doesn't even have a word of thanks or apology :)

And somehow miraculously, it's not miraculous because I took the exam in the same room as him so I knew how wide his groin was when he could drag himself to 3rd year.

So in my 3rd year, I was still stuck with them for one more thesis, but I couldn't stand it anymore so I asked the lecturer to separate groups. (A few words about this lecturer, he is very difficult, super difficult) but I still tried to present and explain to him and in the end I failed, and he was transferred to the group of the second best student in the class :)

In the end, the lecturer let me fail the exam. The good group was blessed with the n factor to join and blamed me for ""don't dump the trash into the sea"". 

In the end, I was once again burdened and passed the subject, I was at a disadvantage again.

Thế là cuối cùng cả 4 đồ án một mình tôi solo và may mắn thay qua hết. Nó còn đéo có 1 lời cám ơn hay hối lỗi cơ :)

Và một cách thần kỳ nào đó, cũng đéo thần kỳ đâu vì tôi thi chung phòng với nó nên tôi biết háng nó cũng rộng thế nào khi nó có thể lết tới năm 3.

This year I'm taking the university entrance exam and need to choose a career. I got a pretty good score in the hsa exam. At that point, you can study if you want to test or study it at UET. I'm very confused about whether I should study it or not.

As for liking it, I am interested in this industry because I have parents who work in this industry, which is also called somewhat successful, or at least has reached a fairly high management level. Basically, I idolize my parents, watch adults work and discuss and confide about work at home, so from then on I have a dream of learning it. In addition, I find this industry also suits my personality - I don't have to travel as much as auditing, and I don't need too many soft skills. What I mean is: soft skills here can be communication, it doesn't have to be too sharp, but of course it is very necessary, no matter what position a person works in.

The reason for my hesitation when deciding to study IT is: I am female, the level of market rejection in this field and my ability to solve math problems.  Talking about the elimination of the market, I also saw it from my own parents - who were also almost laid off, but the good thing was that they realized it a few months early and quickly moved to another place :( Besides, after the age of 40, it is more difficult to get a job in a small industry. I myself am a female, I think about if I have poor health in the future, or want to have children, how will I survive in the industry? As for math, I am not too slow, but I still have to try. I'm not a specialized student and sometimes my performance in math goes up and down because I have to balance other natural subjects.

Hope everyone shares their opinions

p.s: you just said you doubt your ability to survive in the industry after age 35 :::","Xin tư vấn ngành nghề Chào cả nhà voz trên reddit

Em năm nay thi đại học, cần phải chọn ngành nghề. Em thi HSA đạt một số điểm khá ổn. Điểm đấy em có thể học kiểm NEU hoặc học IT ở UET. Em rất băn khoăn về việc bản thân có nên học IT hay không.

Về việc yêu thích IT, em có hứng thú với ngành này là vì em có phụ huynh làm ngành này, cũng gọi là hơi thành công, hoặc ít nhất là đã lên được cấp độ quản lí khá cao. Đại khái, em thần tượng phụ huynh, nhìn người lớn làm việc và trao đổi, tâm sự về công việc ở nhà nên từ đó có ước mơ học IT. Ngoài ra, em thấy ngành này cũng hợp với tính cách của mình - không phải di chuyển nhiều như kiểm toán, kĩ năng mềm thì không cần quá nhiều. Ý em là: kĩ năng mềm ở đây có thể là giao tiếp không cần phải quá sắc sảo, còn tất nhiên là rất cần, bất kể con người làm ở vị trí nào.

Lí do cho sự băn khoăn khi quyết định học IT của em là: bản thân em là nữ, độ đào thải của thị trường ngành này và khả năng giải toán của em.  Nói về sự đào thải của thị trường, em cũng nhìn thấy nó từ chính phụ huynh nhà mình - người cũng suýt bị layoff, nhưng được cái là nhận ra sớm trước vài tháng rồi nhanh chân chuyển đi chỗ khác :( Bên cạnh đó, qua độ tuổi 40 thì ngành IT cũng khó xin việc hơn. Bản thân em là nữ, em nghĩ về việc nếu sau này mình sức khỏe yếu, hoặc muốn có con thì sống sót trong ngành như thế nào? Còn về môn toán thì em cũng không phải quá chậm chạp, nhưng cũng phải cố gắng. Em không phải học sinh chuyên và môn toán của em thỉnh thoảng phong độ nó cũng hơi lên xuống vì phải cân bằng các môn tự nhiên khác. (EM TẠCH IT HUST Ạ - LÝ HÓA PHẢI GỌI LÀ SAI BÉT NHÈ LUÔN) Được cái là tiếng Anh thì em được đầu tư từ bé, nhưng theo em thấy nó cũng không phải là điểm gì nổi bật cho thị trường trong tương lai gần.

The problem I'm having, it sounds very ""stupid"".

Vấn đề mà em đang gặp phải, nghe nó rất là ""ngoo"" ấy ạ. Đã qua hơn nửa năm cuối của đời học sinh rồi, mà em vẫn chưa xác định được tương lai mình sẽ học ngành gì và ra trường làm ngành gì. Em đang thấy rất lo lằng cho tương lai của mình, mông lung vô định chắc cũng ngang chị Dậu😥.

Em có giải nhất thi hsg tỉnh môn Công Nghệ ạ(đây là môn có nhiều tư duy về hình học, phần thi thực hành là vẽ ra 3 hình chiếu vuông góc và hình chiếu trục đo từ 1 hoặc 2 hình cho trước của đề bài, *nói cơ bản là giống đồ họa kĩ thuật trên đại học*), mặc dù học lớp xã hội nhưng tư duy về toán(cả đại và hình) + vật lí khá tốt ạ, còn về hóa với sinh thì........=)))). Tưduy logic và giải quyết vấn đề của em thuộc loại tương đối tốt, khả năng lãnh đạo ít khi thể hiện, tính cách cầu toàn được thể hiện nhiều trong học tập và công việc(tất nhiên là không quá mức như kiểu bị OCD ạ =))

Có anh chị nào từng trải qua khoảng thời gian như em không ạ, và anh chị làm cách nào để xác định được ngành nghề của mình ?

Em mong các anh chị có thể giúp em xác định được ngành mà mình thích hoặc là ngành có thế mạnh ạ.

Em cảm ơn mn rất nhiều🥰.","i don't know what major i'm interested . hello everyone , i bear 2006 , which last year old program ( those who don't know , let's say frankly easily "" if you fail year , you have retake course knowledge from grade 10 ""). problem i'm have , sound very "" stupid "". more than half last year my student life have pass , i still haven't determine what major i will study future what major i will graduate into . i'm feel very worried about my future , uncertain uncertain probably same a a rooster . i get first prize provincial high school exam technology ( a subject a lot think about geometry , practical part draw 3 perpendicular projection an axial projection from 1 2 give image problem , * basically speak it's same a technical graphic university *), even though i'm a social study class , my think about math ( both macro figure ) + physic quite good , a chemistry biology ........=)))). my logical thinking problem solving relatively good , my leadership ability rarely show , my perfectionist personality show a lot study work ( course not extent have ocd =)) have any you go through same time a me , how do you determine your career ? i hope you can help me identify industry i like industry i have strengths . thank you very much .",Normal

1lnf8wy,1751205265.0,2025-06-29 13:54:25,"high school exam scores and abilities from the perspective of a rmit watching the arguments about the high school exam make me itchy. A little background, I studied RMIT so when I took the high school exam I didn't take it too seriously, nor did my family. The reason is that I knew in advance that I would pass the test, so I wasn't too pressured.



Most of us here belong to the poor and working class, that's my analysis, right? I don't say this to show off or divide the award level, but to explain.



Vietnamese people, especially buckeyes, really like to show off their high school test scores. That's why every year there are hundreds of articles about valedictorians, salutatorians, high school students and university entrance exams.



From the perspective of a rmiter, and I confirm that the majority of rmiters also think like me, I find the achievement problem in high school very ridiculous. it does not reflect true ability and has never been a measure.



Most people have above average academic records, a few are excellent students. In short, few people are the school's valedictorian or have as many achievements as Buckey or Flex. Rmit's entrance standards must be said to be the lowest in Vietnam, pay money to learn. But why are Rmit graduates so sought after and highly appreciated?



That's because knowledge at the high school level is general knowledge, it has been around for a long time and anyone can learn. Combined with cramming and memorizing, even if you get a score of 10/10, it doesn't reflect anything, other than the fact that you learned enough by rote.



When evaluating the education system, no country uses scores at the high school level because it is very meaningless.



So why is rmit highly rated? that knowledge is only part of success. The rest are facilities and environment. I'll just take a basic example.



A child studying design/communication at rmit will get the following.



* use mac room
* Online library connected to the global system
* Instructor support available
* Top facilities



specific example. A kid doesn't mind spending 10 million VND to take a voice training course, taught by a TV station MC. Don't hesitate to spend $1000 to be mentored by an expert. From how to create a portfolio to presentation. Not to mention using copyrighted software from start to finish. Let's see, how many public school students in Vietnam can do the same?



It's the same subject, it's the same person, but rmit creates better products because of the foundation behind it.



There's nothing wrong with rote learning in high school, but when you get to college, it doesn't have much meaning. At the university level, it requires you to think independently and creatively. But after studying the knowledge, what can I do? If you don't have the facilities, tools, and network, what can you do?



In recent years, public schools have had a trend of forcing bachelor's students to do scientific research, and then saying that they are not on the same level. but damn rmit didn't do nckh but did dozens of essays and research. The so-called nckh of public schools, let's see how many of them have real value or are they just nonsense to get ranked? Then you think people are so stupid that they don't see? Bachelor's degree level, not enough knowledge or qualifications, how can you study people?



rmit doesn't play that rank climbing game but learns through practice. Right in year 1, I collided with a leading company in the industry. Even the exercises are taken from real problems in the market. But people don't pump up scores.



Vietnamese people are good at studying and are good at learning general knowledge by rote. Then it's important what you can do, do you have the facilities to create products? Therefore, Vietnam cannot train creatives because the training system is stupid from the foundation. This evening I sat there masturbating about being the salutatorian.

  
Now you understand why rmit people are successful because basically, rich people have a better foundation. But they don't care about valedictorians or studious scholarships. The same goes for businesses, professional HR knows clearly what is good at rote learning and good at practice. That's where rmit students are always sought after.","Điểm thi THPT và năng lực từ góc nhìn của một RMIT Theo dõi mấy vụ cãi nhau về kỳ thi thpt nó làm tao ngứa. Chút background, tao học RMIT cho nên lúc thi thpt tao cũng không quá coi trọng, gia đình cũng vậy. Lý do là tao biết trước mình sẽ đậu vô RMIT cho nên không quá áp lực.



Đa số tụi bây ở đây thuộc tầng lớp bần nông và lao động, tao phân tích vậy đúng không. Nói ra không phải để khoe hay phân chia giải cấp gì, mà để giải thích.



Tụi Việt Nam, nhất là buckey, rất khoái đem điểm thi thpt ra khè. Cho nên năm nào cũng có trăm bài báo về thủ khoa, á khoa, của trường thpt và đầu vào ở đại học.



Từ góc nhìn của một RMITer và tao khẳng định là đa số dân RMIT cũng suy nghĩ như tao, tao thấy bệnh thành tích ở thpt rất xàm. Nó không hề phản ánh năng lực thật và chưa bao giờ là thước đo.



Đa số dân RMIT có học bạ trên trên trung bình, số ít là học sinh xuất sắc. Tóm lại là ít ai được thủ khoa của trường hay có mấy thành tích mà đám buckey hay flex. Tiêu chuẩn đầu vào của RMIT phải nói là thấp nhất ở Việt Nam, đóng tiền là học. Nhưng tại sao dân RMIT tốt nghiệp lại được săn đón và đánh giá cao.



Đó là bởi vì kiến thức ở cấp phổ thông là kiến thức chung, nó đã có từ lâu và bất cứ ai cũng có thể học. Cộng thêm việc học nhồi và thuộc lòng thì cho dù mày được điểm 10/10, nó không phản ánh gì, ngoài việc mày học vẹt đủ nhiều.



Khi đánh giá hệ thống giáo dục, cũng đéo có nước nào dùng điểm số ở cấp phổ thông vì nó rất vô nghĩa.



Vậy tại sao RMIT lại được đánh giá cao? Đó là kiến thức chỉ là một phần của thành công. Còn lại là cơ sở vật chất và môi trường. Tao sẽ lấy ví dụ cơ bản thôi nha.



1 đứa học design/communication ở RMIT sẽ được như sau.



* Dùng phòng Mac
* Thư viện online kết nối với hệ thống toàn cầu
* Có giảng viên hỗ trợ
* Cơ sở vật chất hàng đầu



Ví dụ cụ thể. Một đứa RMIT không ngại chi 10 triệu đồng để học một khóa luyện giọng, được dạy bởi một MC đài truyền hình. Cũng không ngại chi $1000 để được mentor bởi một chuyên viên. Từ cách làm portfolio cho đến trình bày. Chưa kể là dùng phần mềm bản quyền từ đầu đến cuối. Thử coi, bao nhiêu đứa sinh viên trường công ở Việt Nam có thể làm tương tự?



Cũng là môn học đó, cũng là con người đó, nhưng đứa RMIT tạo ra sản phẩm tốt hơn bởi vì nền tảng đằng sau.



Học vẹt ở cấp phổ thông không có gì sai, nhưng khi lên đại học, nó không có nhiều ý nghĩa. Ở cấp đại học, nó yêu cầu mày phải tư duy độc lập và sáng tạo. Chứ ôn mớ kiến thức xong rồi làm được gì. Nếu mày không có cơ sở vật chất, công cụ, và mạng lưới thì mày làm được gì.



Mấy năm gần đây thì các trường công có trào lưu ép sinh viên cử nhân làm nghiên cứu khoa học, xong khè nói RMIT không cùng đẳng cấp. Nhưng đm RMIT không làm NCKH mà làm hàng chục bài luận và nghiên cứu. Cái gọi là NCKH của đám trường công, thử coi bao nhiêu cái có giá trị thật hay chỉ là bài tầm xàm để chạy rank? Rồi tụi mày nghĩ người ta ngu tới độ không thấy hả? Cấp cử nhân, chưa đủ kiến thức, chưa có trình độ thì nghiên cứu cc gì ở dân.



RMIT không chơi trò leo rank đó mà học thực hành. Ngay vào năm 1 đã được va chạm với doanh nghiệp đầu ngành rồi. Ngay cả bài tập cũng lấy từ vấn đề thực tế ngoài thị trường. Chứ người ta không có bơm điểm số.



Dân Việt Nam học giỏi, là giỏi học vẹt kiến thức phổ thông. Rồi quan trọng mày làm được gì, có cơ sở vật chất để tạo ra sản phẩm không. Cho nên Việt Nam đéo thể nào đào tạo ra creatives được vì cái hệ thống đào tạo đã ngu từ nền tảng rồi. Tối này ngồi đó thủ dâm về thủ khoa á khoa.

  
Giờ tụi mày đã hiểu vì sao dân RMIT thành công vì về cơ bản, người giàu có nền tảng tốt hơn. Chứ họ không có quan tâm về mấy cái thủ khoa hay học bổng hiếu học. Doanh nghiệp cũng vậy, HR chuyên nghiệp biết rõ đâu là giỏi học vẹt và giỏi thực hành. Sinh viên RMIT luôn được săn đón là ở chỗ đó.","high school exam score ability from perspective a rmit watch argument about high school exam make me itchy . a little background , i study rmit when i take high school exam i didn't take too seriously , nor do my family . reason i know advance i would pass test , i wasn't too pressure . most u here belong poor work class , that's my analysis , right ? i don't say show off divide award level , explain . vietnamese people , especially buckeye , really like show off their high school test score . that's why every year there hundred article about valedictorian , salutatorian , high school student university entrance exam . from perspective a rmiter , i confirm majority rmiters also think like me , i find achievement problem high school very ridiculous . do not reflect true ability have never a measure . most people have above average academic record , a few excellent student . short , few people school's valedictorian have a many achievement a buckey flex . rmit's entrance standard must say low vietnam , pay money learn . why rmit graduate sought after highly appreciate ? that's because knowledge high school level general knowledge , have around a long time anyone can learn . combine cramming memorizing , even if you get a score 10 / 10 , doesn't reflect anything , other than fact you learn enough rote . when evaluate education system , no country use score high school level because very meaningless . why rmit highly rat ? knowledge only part success . rest facility environment . i'll just take a basic example . a child study design / communication rmit will get following . * use mac room * online library connect global system * instructor support available * top facility specific example . a kid doesn't mind spending 10 million vnd take a voice training course , teach a tv station mc . don't hesitate spend $ 1000 mentor an expert . from how create a portfolio presentation . not mention use copyright software from start finish . let's see , how many public school student vietnam can do same ? it's same subject , it's same person , rmit creates well product because foundation behind . there's nothing wrong rote learn high school , when you get college , doesn't have much meaning . university level , require you think independently creatively . after study knowledge , what can i do ? if you don't have facility , tool , network , what can you do ? recent year , public school have have a trend force bachelor's student do scientific research , then say they not same level . damn rmit didn't do nckh do dozen essay research . - call nckh public school , let's see how many them have real value they just nonsense get rank ? then you think people stupid they don't see ? bachelor's degree level , not enough knowledge qualification , how can you study people ? rmit doesn't play rank climb game learn through practice . right year 1 , i collide a lead company industry . even exercise take from real problem market . people don't pump up score . vietnamese people good study good learn general knowledge rote . then it's important what you can do , do you have facility create product ? therefore , vietnam cannot train creatives because training system stupid from foundation . evening i sit there masturbate about salutatorian . now you understand why rmit people successful because basically , rich people have a good foundation . they don't care about valedictorian studious scholarship . same go business , professional hr know clearly what good rote learning good practice . that's where rmit student always seek after .",Normal

If you look at the comments, they say that by studying this, you will be rich and strong...

We understand the importance of these exams (high school, university), the type that determines the destiny of a person's life, but for Westerners, it will be difficult to understand why exams must be ""serious"" like that.

Their mindset is: correct mistakes and slowly progress, think in many directions, find many solutions

If you fail another exam, take another exam. If you fail another exam, change majors, change careers, and change until it suits you. It will not have the mindset of all-in future (60 years of life) for 3 hours of exam, that is too risky but it will create many opportunities, create many directions for you to experience and choose your own path.

Chúng ta hiểu đc tầm quan trọng của những kì thi này (cấp 3, đại học), kiểu quyết định vận mệnh của đời người nhưng đối với tụi tây nó sẽ thấy khó hiểu tại sao phải ""nghiêm trọng hóa"" kì thi đến như vậy

Mindset của tụi nó là: Sai thì sửa và từ từ tiến bộ, Nghĩ nhiều hướng, tìm nhiều cách giải quyết

Thi rớt nữa thi lại, thi rớt nữa thì chuyển ngành, chuyển nghề, thay đổi cho tới khi phù hợp. Nó sẽ không có tư tưởng all-in tương lai (60 năm cuộc đời) cho 3 tiếng thi, như vậy là quá rủi ro mà nó sẽ tạo nhiều cơ hội, tạo nhiều hướng đi để mày trải nghiệm, chọn con đường cho mình

In the past, I also planned to take the ielts exam, but when I thought about it, my family was quite poor, so I checked the tuition fee of about a dozen per course and was afraid that I wouldn't have enough money to study + the additional cost of 5 students was quite embarrassing. So when I tried to figure out what to take to make it easier to get in, the HSAs hit me in the face, so I researched and decided on a course worth 5 students from Hocmai with the hope of taking the exam.


At first, I studied very well and understood the lessons, thinking I would probably score around 100 to get into the school. I was aiming for it until it was time to register and it was a disaster. My intention when taking the HSA exam was to take the exam in the 1st and 3rd rounds, then focus on earning more sat and university, but the day I registered, the network was so bad that I got kicked out a few times and had to register for the last round, but I didn't even get 2 rounds.


Taking the exam 2 months later than expected made me forget almost all the knowledge for the exam (different from the crappy program in the textbook) and got mixed up, causing some below-average survey exams to be talked about tirelessly by the teacher. Plus, with score inflation, something like 100 is certain, then this year it's the average for the exam, so I'm very lucky to get into a new top school.

Lúc đầu tao học rất ổn với hiểu bài nghĩ chắc được tầm 100 để vào trường tao aim cho tới đến lúc đăng ký thì thảm cmn hoạ.Ý định của tao khi thi HSA là thi vào đợt 1 và đợt 3 xong tập trung kiếm thêm SAT và đại học nhưng hôm đăng ký do nhà mạng F như l nên bị out ra vài lần và phải đăng ký đúng đợt cuối cùng mà còn chả đc 2 đợt mà gỡ


Việc thi sau dự kiến 2 tháng khiến tao quên gần như hết kiến thức để thi (khác với chưong trình xàm l trên sgk) và lẫn lộn khiến mấy cái thi khảo sát dưới trung bình bị giáo viên nói tùm lum mệt vcl.Còn thêm lạm phát điểm tương tầm 100 chắc ăn rồi thì năm nay nó là trung bình của kỳ thi hên lắm vào được trường top mới vl

The problem occurred when she asked parents to help review their children's drawings at home

The way to practice for the exam is to redraw an existing picture

My child likes to draw and his paintings are childishly beautiful and creative

But when he was forced to draw according to a pre-existing model, he couldn't draw and when his wife tutored him, he lost patience and raised his voice so the child felt even more pressured. The joy of painting almost disappears and there is no creativity

It's clear that exam pressure kills passion and creativity. If the pressure lasts long, the things you like will turn into things you fear. Leave your mindset alone, innocence and creativity are precious, but you have to accept that society is like that.

1541lpn,1689788332.0,2023-07-19 17:38:52,"Most of the valedictorians and salutators of university entrance exams come from the North, but the South is bad?? Today, reading the article headlined which provinces and cities this year's valedictorians came from, I couldn't help but be surprised ""valedictorians are students from Bac Giang, Thanh Hoa, Hai Phong, Bac Ninh, Hung Yen and Ho Chi Minh City"". This year, there was only one student from the south. A few months ago, the newspaper also headlined a female valedictorian who wrote 21 pages in the literature exam, also from Ha Tinh (outer region).

The vast majority of salutatorian valedictorians are held by outsiders, which is consistent with Mr. Trong's criteria ""the general secretary must be a qualified northerner"". But even though there are so many salutatorian valedictorians, the economy of these regions is one of the poorest in the country, always having to receive aid from the southern provinces (Saigon pays 85% of taxes to the central government). The paradox here is why the foreign region is so good and is one of the largest forces going to xkld, while the south is very small. Furthermore, the vast majority of the defendants in the rescue flight case are mostly from outside the country and are preparing for sentencing.

 In this education, the phrase ""comprehensive good"" appears, which is quite strange because there are no perfections. No one in this world is good at everything. How can you judge Ngo Bao Chau by whether he has learned music theory well or not? Or judge Stephen Hawking by whether he can jump on the bar or not? 

The pursuit of comprehensive excellence is an illusory destination, even Uncle Ho, who is preached about shining morality all day long, directed the implementation of land reform that killed hundreds of thousands of people. After that, he just apologized and was done. Without resigning, he still brazenly sat on the chairman's chair until his death. This is difficult for the heads of state of other countries to match.

Remember, the people who came up with the educational curriculum were all from outside the country, ""they"" eliminated all the curriculum coming from the South. So their children can easily enjoy the essence of that education, but to say whether it works or not, let other countries judge.","Thủ khoa, á khoa kì thi đại học đa phần đều đến từ miền bắc, miền nam dở?? Hôm nay đọc bài báo được giật tít các thủ khoa năm nay đến từ các tỉnh thành nào mà không khỏi giật mình ""thủ khoa là học sinh của Bắc Giang, Thanh Hóa, Hải Phòng, Bắc Ninh, Hưng Yên và TP.HCM"". Năm nay chỉ lọt thỏm được 1 bạn đến từ phía nam, cách đây vài tháng báo cũng giật tít được 1 nữ thủ khoa viết 21 trang giấy trong kì thi văn cũng đến từ Hà Tĩnh (miền ngoài).

Đại đa phần thủ khoa á khoa đều do miền ngoài nắm cả, điều này phù hợp với tiêu chí của bác Trọng "" Tổng bí thư phải là người bắc có ní nuận"". Nhưng mặc dù nhiều thủ khoa á khoa như vậy nhưng kinh tế của những vùng này thuộc dạng èo uột nhất nước, luôn phải nhận viện trợ từ các tỉnh thành phía nam ( sài gòn đóng 85% thuế cho trung ương). Nghịch lý là chỗ này tại sao miền ngoài giỏi như vậy lại là một trong những lực lượng đi xkld đông đảo nhất, trong khi miền nam lại rất ít. Còn nữa, đại đa số những bị can trong vụ chuyến bay giải cứu đa số là người miền ngoài đang chuẩn bị kết án.

 Trong nền giáo dục này lại xuất hiện một cụm từ ""giỏi toàn diện"" điều này khá là quái đản bởi vì nhân vô thập toàn. Trên đời này chẳng có ai cái gì cũng giỏi cả, làm sao bạn có thể đánh giá Ngô bảo châu qua việc ông có học tốt nhạc lý hay không? Hay đánh giá Stephen Hawking qua việc ông có thể nhảy xà hay không à? 

Việc theo đuổi cái giỏi toàn diện là một đích đến ảo tưởng, thậm chí bác Hồ người suốt ngày được rao giảng đạo đức sáng ngời đã chỉ đạo thực hiện Cải Cách Ruộng Đất làm chết hàng trăm ngàn người. Sau đó chỉ lên xin lỗi là xong, không từ chức ông vẫn trơ trẽn ngồi chễm chệ trên chiếc ghế chủ tịch cho đến khi qua đời. Điều này đến các nguyên thủ quốc gia của các nước khác cũng khó mà bì kịp.

Nên nhớ những người nghĩ ra giáo trình giáo dục đều đến từ miền ngoài, ""họ"" đã loại bỏ tất cả những giáo trình đến từ nguồn gốc miền nam. Vậy nên bản thân con em của họ có thể dễ dàng thụ hưởng được tinh hoa của nền giáo dục đó, còn để nói được việc hay không thôi thì cứ để các nước khác đánh giá.","most valedictorian salutators university entrance exams come from north , south bad ?? today , read article headline which province city year's valedictorian come from , i couldn't help surprised "" valedictorian student from bac giang , thanh hoa , hai phong , bac ninh , hung yen ho chi minh city "". year , there only one student from south . a few month ago , newspaper also headline a female valedictorian who write 21 page literature exam , also from ha tinh ( out region ). vast majority salutatorian valedictorian hold outsider , which consistent mr . trong's criterion "" general secretary must a qualified northerner "". even though there many salutatorian valedictorian , economy these region one poor country , always have receive aid from southern province ( saigon pay 85 % tax central government ). paradox here why foreign region good one large force go xkld , while south very small . furthermore , vast majority defendant rescue flight case mostly from outside country prepare sentence . education , phrase "" comprehensive good "" appear , which quite strange because there no perfection . no one world good everything . how can you judge ngo bao chau whether he have learn music theory well not ? judge stephen hawk whether he can jump bar not ? pursuit comprehensive excellence an illusory destination , even uncle ho , who preach about shin morality all day long , direct implementation land reform kill hundred thousand people . after , he just apologize do . without resign , he still brazenly sit chairman's chair until his death . difficult head state other country match . remember , people who come up educational curriculum all from outside country , "" they "" eliminate all curriculum come from south . their child can easily enjoy essence education , say whether work not , let other country judge .",Normal

I'm planning to study for a master's degree in Poland so I want to ask for more experience.

Your information:

* studying IT (bachelor of IT - business cooperation) in Vietnam, currently completed 2 years, gpa \~7.45/10 (\~2.88/4). If you try hard, you can get to 3-3.4 when you graduate
* I will try to learn more about English, planning to take the ielts/toefl exam.
* want to choose a school **outside the capital warsaw** for cheaper costs (heard that Kraków, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań are quite popular).

I wonder:

\- gpa around 3.0-3.4, is there a chance to apply master it there?

\- Do schools outside the capital have any good English programs (because I find Polish quite difficult to learn)

\- Where should you search to find accurate application information for international students? I tried searching for a few schools, but the information for international students was quite limited. I mainly searched for study abroad centers.

Please everyone, please explain. many thanks

Mình đang tính đi du học Thạc sĩ ở Ba Lan nên muốn hỏi thêm kinh nghiệm.

* Học IT (cử nhân CNTT- Hợp tác doanh nghiệp) ở VN, hiện đã xong 2 năm, GPA \~7.45/10 (\~2.88/4). Nếu ráng thì lúc tốt nghiệp có thể lên 3-3.4
* Tiếng Anh thì mình sẽ cố học thêm, dự định thi IELTS/TOEFL.
* Muốn chọn trường **ngoài thủ đô Warsaw** để chi phí rẻ hơn (nghe nói Kraków, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań khá phổ biến).

Mình thắc mắc:

\- GPA tầm 3.0-3.4 có cơ hội apply Master IT bên đó không?

\- Các trường ngoài thủ đô có chương trình tiếng Anh nào ổn không (Vì tiếng Ba Lan theo mình thấy khá khó học)

\- Để tra cứu chính xác các thông tin apply cho du học sinh thì nên search ở đâu. Mình có thử search vài trường nhưng thông tin cho du học sinh khá ít, chủ yếu search ra các trung tâm du học.

I have to say frankly that the literature part of this year's high school graduation exam is the first part is the artistic analysis of the poem ""Toad"" by a colonel of the People's Newspaper.   
Fuck this type of poetry that is like a dickhead, can't read rhymes, but is analyzed like a masterpiece.

The story is that I was grouped with two friends to do the same graduation thesis.

Because I interned for 6 months while the others had a shorter internship, they proactively asked for topics in advance and did it slowly before the registration period (please do it first until registration, then register later). The work was only about 15-20% completed. During the registration period, it turned out that there was one person in that group who was not eligible to participate due to lack of credits. and that group let the other person out.

I was the one invited to join the group to replace the other friend. I was invited in and didn't ask for anything. I didn't know anything, they took the initiative to call and contact me to say that such a friend was out and invited me in.

I'm also about to graduate and haven't found a work partner yet, so I listened to the invitation with enthusiasm and agreed to join. but forget to think about things that may happen later.

And what started was that when 2 months later, I successfully registered for the project, released my personal budget, and worked up to about 40%, the group started to have the attitude that I was the one taking the short end of the stick... like bringing me in just to divide the project funding even though there was an exchange from the beginning... and I also seriously carried out the assignments and didn't care about anything.

 There was a friend in the previous group who had a bit of a conflict with me and kept asking me to invite the friend who was out to go out drinking because he thought that about 20% of the work done before I joined had that friend's contribution. During work, he also had a bad attitude towards me. 
I also agreed to invite the whole group out for a drink because I felt like I would also benefit when they invited me to hang out like that.
 
and the situation is that the group is still working on the topic, but conflicts occur like v. Now I register to participate and pay the money, but I can't withdraw because I'm considered irresponsible and very annoying. It's not fun to continue doing it because I'm the subject of criticism if something bad about the thesis happens like bad defense or not being able to answer questions or something... more importantly, I have a reputation for being bad at it even though I still do sml.
Please give me some advice","Mẫu thuẫn với bạn làm cùng đồ án Chào anh chi, em là con trai , năm 4 và đang làm đồ án tố nghiệp !
Chuyện là em có ghép nhóm cùng 2 bạn để làm cùng đồ án tốt nghiệp.

Do em thực tập tận 6 tháng còn các bạn kia thì ngắn hơn nên các bạn đã chủ động xin trước đề tài và thực hiện từ từ khi chưa đến đợt đăng kí thực hiện ( xin làm trước tới khi đăng kí thì đăng kí sau )  Công việc hoàn thành khoảng 15-20% thôi. Đến đợt đăng kí thì lòi ra có một bạn ở nhóm đó chưa đủ điều kiện tham gia do thiếu tín chỉ. Và nhóm đó cho bạn kia out.

Em là người được mời vô nhóm để thay thế bạn kia, em được rủ vào chứ không tự xin xỏ gì hết. Em không biết gì cả, Tụi nó chủ động gọi liên lạc nói là bị out một bạn như vậy và rủ em vào.

Em thì cũng đang nôn tốt nghiệp và chưa tìm được  bạn làm cùng nên nghe mời với thái độ nhiệt tình nên cũng đồng ý tham gia . Mà quên suy nghĩ kỉ những thứ sau này có thể gặp phải.

Và chuyện bắt đầu là khi  sau đó 2 tháng ,đăng kí đề tài thành công, xuất kinh phí cá nhân ra và làm đến khoảng 40% thì nhóm bắt đầu có thái độ em là người ăn ké….kiểu đưa em vào chỉ để chia tiền kinh phí làm dự án mặc dù là đã có trao đổi ngay từ đầu… và em cũng thực hiện nghiêm túc các phân công chứ k qua loa gì.

 Có một bạn ở nhóm trước đây có tí mâu thuẫn với em thì liên tục đòi em phải mời bạn bị out kia đi nhậu vì cho rằng khoảng 20% công việc đã thực hiên trước khi em tham gia có sự đóng góp của bạn đó. Trong quá trình làm việc cũng có thái độ không tốt với em. 
Em cũng đồng ý mời cả nhóm đi nhậu vì cảm thấy mình cũng được lợi ích khi tụi nó rủ mình vô ngang như vậy.
 
Và tình hình là nhóm vẫn đang thực hiện đề tài , nhưng mâu thuẫn xảy ra như v. Bây giờ đăng kí tham gia và xuất kinh phí rồi không thể rút lui vì bị cho là thiếu trách nhiệm và rất phiền. Làm tiếp thì không vui vẻ gì vì mình là đối tượng nhận sự trỉ trích nếu có gì đó không tốt về đồ án xảy ra như bảo vệ không tốt hay vấn đáp trả lời không được gì đó … là hơn cả là mình mang tiếng ăn ké mặc dù vẫn làm sml.

Summary: This woman is married to a police officer, has 1 son, lives in an apartment in District 2. This guy often shows hooliganism, beats, and tortures his wife like in the Middle Ages, so this woman decided to divorce. Then this police officer hired 4 gangsters to kidnap this woman's son to force her to return to him. This woman had to accept going back. After 10 days, the police officer pushed her down from the 9th floor of the apartment building. The witness was her child, saying his father pushed his mother down. In addition, the witness also had a resident on the ground, ready to testify in court despite being threatened.  This family reported the case, handed over all evidence to the police, but no one was willing to handle it, the case was suspended, the conclusion was suicide, and the witness's testimony was rejected. This family distributed leaflets at Ben Thanh market, went to Hanoi to complain, went to the old man to meet the grandmother asking for help, in general no one was willing to help, it turned out because the father was the head of a prison under the Ministry of Public Security. Now they are even posting articles accusing him of causing a color revolution to incite people. The victim's family's Facebook and Tiktok names are Phan Minh Hien.

1nh9sdw,1757902569.0,2025-09-15 02:16:09,"[confession] 32 year old loser I'm 32 years old, no wife, no kids, no career, overall a real loser. Sitting here typing these lines, I feel like my life is just like the meme ""I'm fine"" but in reality it's not fine at all. In the past, when I first graduated, I also dreamed a lot, thinking I would make it big, make billions of money, marry a good wife, have a big house and a car. Who would have thought, his life is like a vtv movie.



When I was 20 years old, I studied IT at university and had some coding talent. Graduated, got a job at a small company, salary was three dong. After working for a few years, the company went bankrupt and I was unemployed. At that time, I simply thought, ""Okay, find another job"". Anyone who has gone through it will know how difficult it is to find a job, especially when their CV only has meager experience. Just keep applying, keep interviewing, then keep getting rejected. Suddenly I feel so useless.



Then I jumped into freelance work, coding around, taking on random projects. Some months I earn quite a bit, buy a new phone, go out drinking with friends who show off. But most of them are working day and night, chasing deadlines, and customers are pressing them like debt collectors. There was a time when I worked on a project for a whole month and the customer refused to pay me. I was so angry that I couldn't do anything. Since then, I've become lazy and lost motivation. Every time I open my laptop, I just want to watch YouTube or play games. When I'm hungry, I automatically make a bowl of instant noodles. achieved my record of eating instant noodles for 20 consecutive days



Now I'm 32 years old, I'm still living in a rented house, 15m2 room, messy furniture, rats running around. Friends of the same age buy a house, get married, and have children in kindergarten. As for me, my bank account is always under 2 accounts, and my credit card debt is piling up. Every time my friends invite me to coffee, I always refuse because I'm shy, because my pocket is empty, because I'm afraid of hearing their success stories.



I also loved, loved deeply. That girl is 5 years younger than me, pretty and good, but I didn't have anything at that time, just a soft mouth. After 2 years of dating, he broke up and told me I had no future. It hurts like hell, but thinking about it, it's right. What do I have that I want to keep? From then on, I didn't dare to love anyone again, for fear of making others suffer



Now, every day I ask myself: ""What do you live for?"". One day I was drinking alone, looking at the beer bottle and wanting to cry. But you know, even though I'm a loser, I still want to try again. I just signed up for an online course, learning some new technology. Who knows, at 35 years old, I will change my life? Or at least, don't have to sit here and complain like this anymore



Loser life is boring, but I still don't want to give up. Probably because I'm stubborn. Okay, I'm done typing, I'm going to bed, I'll continue plowing tomorrow.

Ngồi gõ mấy dòng này mà thấy đời mình y như cái meme ""tôi ổn"" mà thật ra éo ổn tẹo nào. Hồi xưa, mới ra trường, tao cũng mơ mòng lắm, kiểu nghĩ mình sẽ làm nên trò, kiếm tiền tỉ, cưới vợ xịn, nhà lầu xe hơi. Ai ngờ đâu, đời nó éo như phim VTV.



Hồi 20t, tao học ĐH, ngành CNTT, cũng có tí năng khiếu code. Ra trường, xin đc việc ở cty nhỏ, lương ba cọc ba đồng. Làm đc vài năm, cty phá sản, tao thất nghiệp. Lúc đó nghĩ đơn giản, ""thôi, kiếm việc khác"". Tml nào trải qua sẽ biết kiếm việc khó vcl, nhất là khi CV của mình chỉ có kinh nghiệm lèo tèo. Cứ apply, cứ phỏng vấn, rồi cứ bị reject. Tự nhiên thấy mình vô dụng vãi chưởng.



Rùi tao nhảy qua làm freelancer, code dạo, nhận dự án lung tung. Có tháng kiếm đc kha khá, mua đc con đt mới, đi nhậu vs lũ bạn khoe khoang. Nhưng mà phần lớn là cày ngày cày đêm, deadline dí sát đít, khách hàng thì giục như đòi nợ. Có lần làm dự án cả tháng, khách quỵt tiền, tao cay mà éo làm gì đc. Từ đó, tao lười dần, mất động lực. Cứ mở laptop là chỉ muốn coi YouTube hoặc cày game, đói thì tự động làm bát mì tôm. Đcm kỉ lục ăn mì tôm của t 20 ngày liên tiếp



Giờ 32t, tao vẫn ở trọ, phòng 15m2, đồ đạc bừa bộn, chuột chạy lung tung. Bạn bè cùng lứa thì đứa mua nhà, đứa cưới vợ, đứa có con đi mẫu giáo. Còn tao, tk ngân hàng lúc nào cũng dưới 2 củ, nợ thẻ tín dụng thì chất đống. Mỗi lần tụi bạn rủ đi cafe, tao toàn từ chối vì ngại, vì túi rỗng, vì sợ nghe tụi nó kể chuyện thành công.



Tao cũng từng yêu, yêu sâu đậm lun. Con bé đó nhỏ hơn tao 5t, xinh, ngoan, nhưng mà tao lúc đó éo có gì, chỉ có cái miệng dẻo. Yêu đc 2 năm thì nó chia tay, bảo tao hông có tương lai. Đau vãi, nhưng nghĩ lại, nó nói đúng. Tao có gì đâu mà đòi giữ ngta? Từ đó tao éo dám yêu ai nữa, sợ lại làm khổ người khác



Bây giờ, ngày nào tao cũng tự hỏi: ""Mày sống để làm gì?"". Có hôm nhậu 1 mình, nhìn chai bia mà muốn khóc. Nhưng mà mày biết hông, dù loser, tao vẫn muốn thử lại. Tao mới đk 1 khóa học online, học thêm mấy cái công nghệ mới. Biết đâu, 35t, tao đổi đời? Hoặc ít nhất, hông phải ngồi đây than thở thế này nữa



Đời loser, nó chán thiệt, nhưng tao vẫn chưa muốn bỏ cuộc. Chắc tại tao cứng đầu. Thôi, gõ xong rùi, đi ngủ đây, mai còn cày tiếp.

This afternoon I went for a snack at a sidewalk restaurant. On the table are bottles of beer and some chicken dishes. Sitting and confiding and watching other people eat, drink and have fun, I naturally understood why this place is called a happy country.
When nas daily said ""78% of Vietnamese people are currently happy or very happy"", it received a lot of ridicule from the online community. But if you take the time to reflect and observe, you must admit that it is reality. Most people feel very satisfied, so they are happy. This is probably one of the confusing things.
A working family, although not rich, is still happy. On the contrary, a rich family has enough material resources but is not happy. Happiness is only a relative concept. it has almost nothing to do with national prosperity, democracy, human rights, economic development or social welfare. Because each person has their own definition.
So what is happiness for Vietnamese people?
A worker's happiness is waking up in the morning, eating lunch, working overtime to earn more money in the afternoon, and going back to sleep at night. On weekends, I invite friends and colleagues to go to a restaurant to talk. At the end of the month, I have money to send home to support my family in the countryside. that's all they need.
The happiness of a girl in her twenties is to be pretty, take selfies, upload them to Facebook or Instagram and get many likes. Moreover, it will catch the eye of a rich man and have a life like a fairy. 
A student's happiness is not failing the subject, getting a degree and graduating, and in his free time, playing soccer with friends or going on a trip somewhere far away from the city.
An office worker's happiness is receiving a salary at the end of the month, getting promoted and having more money. Every afternoon, I go out drinking with my colleagues and talk bad about my boss and my old company. Anyone who is motivated should send their CV to find a better job. More position and money is happiness.
The happiness of a state employee is to go to work in the morning, eat lunch at noon, and go home in the evening without having to do anything. Life is peaceful and stable.
The happiness of ""photographers"" is timing to take beautiful photos. then uploaded it online with the words ""Vietnam is beautiful."" The happiness of those studying abroad is to be able to go here and there, graduate, apply to stay, get a green card, and become naturalized citizen.
Next are the gamers, their happiness is to press the keyboard and mouse to kill virtual opponents to get many rewards and a feeling of conquest. And kol's boys and girls are happy when they get a lot of views and are known by many people.
And every time a Vietnamese football team plays, the happiness of the entire people is when the team scores a goal. The bigger thing is to win a prize so everyone has an excuse to storm through the night. waving flags and shouting ""Vietnam champions.""
Vietnamese people today only need those things. Happiness is cups of milk tea, drinking sessions, virtual likes, selfies, football matches and outings. rather than democracy, they don't care. Nor is it freedom, because it is too vague. nor are they human rights because currently the right to live and enjoy oneself is enough.
polluted country? “Where is that not the case, our country is developing.” corruption? “why don't you look positive?” theft? “It's the same everywhere, you have to be more optimistic in life.”
So it's not too difficult to understand why this place is full of joy and happiness. Don't ask them to learn about other things, they won't mind. Don't say the opposite, because they don't want to hear it. This country is very happy. 
People are like drunkards. “one two three, dzo, two three dzo, two three dzo.”
ku hammer @ ku hammer cafe","Hạnh phúc của người Việt Nam „…không quá khó hiểu vì sao nơi này tràn đầy niềm vui và hạnh phúc…   Người dân như những bợm nhậu. “Một hai ba, dzô, hai ba dzô, hai ba dzô.” „

Chiều hôm nay tôi đi ăn vặt ở một quán nhậu vỉa hè. Trên bàn là chai bia và vài món gà. Ngồi tâm sự và nhìn người khác ăn uống và vui tươi, tôi tự nhiên hiểu vì sao nơi này được gọi là đất nước hạnh phúc.
Khi Nas Daily nói “78% người Việt hiện tại đang hạnh phúc hoặc rất hạnh phúc” thì đã nhận được nhiều lời chê cười từ cộng đồng mạng. Nhưng nếu chịu khó bỏ chút thời gian suy ngẫm và quan sát thì cũng phải thừa nhận rằng đó là thực tế. Đa số người dân cảm thấy rất hài lòng, cho nên họ hạnh phúc. Đây có lẽ là một trong những điều khó hiểu.
Một gia đình lao động tuy không giàu nhưng vẫn hạnh phúc. Ngược lại, một gia đình giàu tuy có đầy đủ vật chất nhưng không hạnh phúc. Hạnh phúc chỉ là khái niệm mang tính chất tương đối. Nó gần như không liên quan gì đến sự hịnh vượng của quốc gia, dân chủ, nhân quyền, phát triển kinh tế hay phúc lợi xã hội. Vì mỗi người có một định nghĩa riêng.
Vậy Hạnh Phúc đối với người Việt Nam là thế nào?
Hạnh phúc của một người lao động là sáng thức dậy, trưa ăn cơm, chiều được tăng ca để có thêm tiền và tối về ngủ. Cuối tuần thì hẹn bạn bè đồng nghiệp ra quán tâm sự. Cuối tháng có tiền gửi về nuôi gia đình dưới quê. Họ chỉ cần nhiêu đó thôi.
Hạnh phúc của một cô gái tuổi đôi mươi là được xinh, chụp ảp tự sướng, up lên Facebook hay Instagram và được nhiều like. Hơn nữa là sẽ lọt vào mắt của một anh đại gia nào và có cuộc sống như tiên. 
Hạnh phúc của một cậu sinh viên là không nợ môn, học lấy được cái bằng rồi tốt nghiệp, rảnh thì đi đá banh với bạn bè hoặc đi phượt đâu đó xa xa thành phố.
Hạnh phúc của một nhân viên văn phòng là cuối tháng nhận lương, được thăng chức và có thêm tiền. Mỗi chiều thì đi nhậu với đồng nghiệp và nói xấu sếp và công ty cũ. Ai có động lực thì gửi CV tìm việc khác tốt hơn. Thêm chức và tiền là hạnh phúc.
Hạnh phúc của một viên chức nhà nước là sáng đi làm, trưa ăn cơm, chiều đi về mà không cần phải làm gì. Cuộc sống thật yên bình và ổn định.
Hạnh phúc của những bạn “photographer” là canh thời điểm để chụp những tấm thật đẹp. Sau đó up lên mạng với dòng chữ “Việt Nam thật đẹp.” Hạnh phúc của những bạn du học là được đi đó đây, học tốt nghiệp, xin ở lại, lấy thẻ xanh, nhập tịch.
Tiếp theo là mấy gamers, hạnh phúc của họ là bấm bàn phím và chuột để diệt đối thủ ảo để được nhiều thưởng và có cảm giác chinh phục. Còn mấy bạn trai gái KOL thì hạnh phúc khi được nhiều view và nhiều người biết đến.
Còn mỗi lần có đội tuyển bóng đá Việt Nam đá, hạnh phúc của toàn dân là khi đội ghi bàn. Lớn hơn là thắng cái giải gì đó để mọi người có cớ đi bão xuyên đêm. Tay vẫy cờ và hô “Việt Nam vô địch.”
Người Việt Nam hiện tại chỉ cần những thứ đó. Hạnh phúc là những ly trà sữa, những buổi nhậu, những cái like ảo, những tấm ảnh tự sướng, những trận bóng đá và những chuyến đi chơi. Chứ không phải là dân chủ, họ bất cần. Cũng không phải là tự do, vì nó quá mơ hồ. Cũng không phải là nhân quyền vì hiện tại quyền để được sống và tự sướng là đủ.
Đất nước ô nhiễm? “Ở đâu mà không vậy, nước mình đang phát triển mà.” Tham nhũng? “Sao bạn không nhìn tích cực?” Trộm cắp? “Ở đâu cũng vậy thôi, sống phải lạc quan lên chứ.”
Cho nên cũng không quá khó hiểu vì sao nơi này tràn đầy niềm vui và hạnh phúc. Bạn đừng kêu họ tìm hiểu về những thứ khác, họ sẽ không bận tâm đâu. Bạn đừng nói ngược lại, vì họ không muốn nghe. Đất nước này rất hạnh phúc. 
Người dân như những bợm nhậu. “Một hai ba, dzô, hai ba dzô, hai ba dzô.”

I'm 25 years old in the North. I studied in the US around 2017-2019, but didn't have enough experience living there, so I returned to Vietnam with no direction until 2020 to return to study computer science (affiliated with Troy University) at Hanoi Polytechnic (international department), preparing to graduate in October this year. However, most of the navigators in charge of the department register for many impractical subjects, and 90% of the courses are taught by polytechnic lecturers (95% of teachers come to read slides, are forced to do a bunch of rambling projects, do not have the opportunity to do projects to foster experience, etc). 

In addition to the fact that I was too passive and only paid attention to passing the political courses of the school's debt and the courses of some heartless lecturers, now I'm just waiting for a CS degree from the US with a GPA of 3.17, but in fact I feel like I can't reflect on anything, and now it's difficult to apply for an internship.

I first chose the major because I didn't have enough points to get into the mass-market system but only enough to get into the high-quality system. My family is not rich, but my parents managed to save money and agreed to let me study in the CLC system.

What I want to say is that my university class is full of people with good conditions, good backgrounds or very strong families behind them. Almost 1/3 of my class wants to continue the family business...

As for me, I'm the type of person who doesn't have the conditions to go there, so I'm far behind my friends. Besides, I see that there are many differences, my friends come from good backgrounds so there is a certain distance from me, rich people and poor people don't have the same mindset, things like that.
 I'm very shy about making friends. Besides studying in the same group, I rarely hang out or have sex because conditions don't allow it.

  My studies are ok, good but not bad, I'm on schedule and don't owe anything.

At the end of the second year, I hung out with a group of 5 friends and they were compatible. They asked to come home and play, but I agreed because my house is in Long An, close to Ho Chi Minh City. I think with the mindset of just letting them know that your family is poor, if you can't play, then withdraw... and the odds are like you said. After that trip, I left the group because my skin was not suitable.

After that, other than being in the same study group, I wasn't close to anyone. After finishing the course, everyone became friends...

The lesson I see is that you should choose an environment that suits you and your abilities

Right now, I'm in the graduation thesis phase, and I'm joining a group of friends to work on it together. We've been together for a while so we also want to maintain relationships with our friends. Looking back later when we grow up, we'll be happy, but going through a difficult time without accumulating any friends will be sad.


Can you give me some advice, should I invite them back to see my family situation like the first time?

Trước chọn ngành vì không đủ điểm vào hệ đại trà mà chỉ đủ vào hệ chất lượng cao. Nhà em thì không giàu, nhưng ba mẹ cũng tích góp được và đồng ý để em học hệ CLC.

Chuyện em muốn nói là lớp ĐH của em toàn các bạn có điều kiện , xuất thân tốt hoặc có gia đình phía sau rất vững chắc. Gan 1/3 lớp em là về nối nghiệp gia đình…

Còn em thì kiểu nhà k có điều kiện mà đu vô đó nên thua xa các bạn. Với lại em thấy có sự khác nhau lắm, các bạn có xuất thân tốt nên có khoảng cách nào đó với em, người giàu với người nghèo tư tưởng nó k giống nhau ấy, kiểu v.
 Em rất ngại kết bạn, ngoài học nhóm chung ra thì cũng ít đi chơi cùng )hay an nhau gi vì điều kiện cũng hong cho phép lắm.

  Em thì học ok , khá chứ kh tệ, cũng đi đúng tiến độ và không nợ gì.

Cuối năm 2 em có chơi cùng một nhóm bạn 5 bạn cũng hợp, tụi bạn đòi về nhà chơi em cũng chịu vì nhà em ở long an, sát bên tphcm . E thì với tư tưởng cứ cho tụi nó biết nhà mình nghèo đi, chơi k đc thì rút … và cái kets giống em nói. Sau chuyến đi ấy thì em tách nhóm vì da thấy không phù hợp.

Sau đó thì ngoài ghép nhóm học chung thì em không thân thiết với ai cả, xong môn rồi thì thân ai nấy lo…

Bài học thì em thấy r, nên chọn môi trường phù hợp với bản thân và năng lực của mình

Đến giờ thì đang giai đoạn đồ án tốt nghiệp, em đang ghép cùng một nhóm bạn để làm cùng. Đồng hành cùng một khoảng thời gian nên cũng muốn giữ quan hệ với các bạn, sau này lớn lên nhìn lại cũng vui chứ qua một khúc ĐH mà không tích luỹ được đứa bạn nào cũng buồn.

So now I can think of two ways. One is to finish studying because I haven't failed the subject yet and only have the thesis to finish. The other is to drop out of school and return to my hometown to serve so I can have time to think. But really, I'm so tired, I feel like I've been studying since I went to college, and the excitement of being 18 years old is now only depression after 4 years.

That side also sells rice, and here also sells rice, but the difference is night and day. These students, even though they were beaten and had their records examined for generations to come, still stood up. Representing the young generation, they are patriots, they pity their compatriots who are suffering because of the wrong policies of the ruling class. Then you see that just a short time after those protests, pooh huh, you have to slowly stop doing that stupid at studying thing.



And over here, this son of a bitch has killed tens of thousands of southerners and not a single one of them dares to say anything. nothing. feed on the bones and blood of fellow human beings. He kept cursing corruption 3 times, but at least he didn't dry up the corpses when the country was in its most dire straits.



The humble people deserve to be enslaved. Those worms are never qualified to be noble East Asians like Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans.

1f8fuh8,1725409943.0,2024-09-04 00:32:23,"Income and taxes in the US for new graduate students Lately, I've seen many articles comparing tax rates and life between the thirsty 3 stripes of California and the real estate paradise, so I also wanted to share a post so that everyone in the group can have more perspectives.

background: newly graduated engineer in cali, working for a government agency (not cs or it)

**gross income: 75,000**

**contributions:**

1. pension: 6,000 (8% of gross income), mandatory
2. opeb (retirement health insurance): 1,500 (2% of gross income), mandatory
3. 401k, iras (retirement account): 30,000, not required, add more or less depending on your ability. Traditional ira/401k is also known as pre-tax ira: you do not have to pay tax when you put it in (contribution) but only pay tax when you take it out (distribution). Conversely, roth ira/401k is also called post tax: tax free when taken out but must pay tax when put in. Let's leave half for ease of understanding, but if you want to calculate specifically which one is more beneficial, it depends on many other factors. 
4. social security and medical tax: 5,738 (7.65% of gross income), mandatory

**Benefits of the above contributions:**

1. pension: if you work continuously for 35 years, when you retire, you will receive 75% of your highest year's income. Suppose the highest salary is 150k, 75% is 112,500.
2. Free lifetime health insurance if working for 20 years (company pays)
3. with a 5% return rate over 35 years (pretty conservative + adjusment for inflation, but sp500 average return rate is 10%), there will be 3m in retirement account.
4. receive about 40k/year. This social security amount is too small so I don't calculate it specifically.

**tax:** single person, standard deduction is 14,600 for federal and 5,363 for cali state. 

1. federal income tax: taxable income will be calculated using gross income-standard deduction-pension-opeb-traditional ira which will be 37,900. According to the federal tax bracket, it will pay 4,316.
2. state income tax: similar to calculating taxable income, it will be 47,137. Based on the California tax bracket, it will be 1,452.
3. So the total amount of **tax** to pay is 5,768. effective tax rate is only 7.69%

**net income**: = gross income-contributions-tax = **25,995**

**expense: 1,500/month**

1. house: share room 700
2. eat: 300
3. Vehicle insurance: 400
4. other costs: 100

With this standard of living, many people will think I live a miserable or miserable life, but actually I feel very comfortable. If you want to have more fun, or have a family and children, then put less into your retirement fund.

**forgot to add benefits:** 

1. Health insurance plus dental insurance with vision insurance for 1 month is about 1,000. But you only have to pay $30, the company pays the rest. Very good insurance, low copay and low deductible. A visit to the doctor only costs a few dozen dong. My wife can also take advantage of my insurance and giving birth doesn't cost any money. Let's talk about American insurance, it's bad because the cost is very high, but the service and level of doctors in the international hospitals in Vietnam have no comparison. 
2. There are 20 paid time off days per year + 11 paid holidays. The longer you do it, the more you get.
3. work life balance: hybrid wfh 3 days/week. 40 hour work week. ot is very rare and if there is, it will be paid 1.5. When the time is up, turn off the computer and turn off the phone. No boss will call. It's very chill, so if you're diligent, you'll even do second jobs and side gigs to earn a lot of extra money. 

A year will have about 8,000 left over to travel or do whatever you like =)) fuck you money. But that's just the lowest salary for new graduates. But engineers only need to work 3-4 years to reach 100k.

 Work 35 years to 60 years old and have 3 million in your retirement account. The annual pension with SS is about 150k, but at that time you only pay taxes and no longer have to contribute to pension with SS, insurance is free.

  
As for polytechnic engineers in Vietnam, please compare.","Thu nhập và thuế ở Mỹ của sinh viên mới ra trường Dạo này thấy nhiều bài so sánh về mức thuế và đời sống giữa 3 sọc Cali khát nước với thiên đường cỗng sản nên tao cũng muốn lên bài chia sẽ để anh em trong group có thêm nhiều góc nhìn

Background: kĩ sư mới ra trường ở Cali, làm việc cho một cơ quan chính phủ (không phải CS hay IT)

**Gross income: 75,000**

**Contributions:**

1. Pension (lương hưu): 6,000 (8% of gross income), bắt buộc
2. OPEB (bảo hiểm sức khỏe lúc về hưu): 1,500 (2% of gross income) , bắt buộc
3. 401k, IRAs (tài khoản hưu trí) : 30,000, không bắt buộc, bổ vô nhiều hay ít tùy khả năng của mình. Traditional IRA/401k hay gọi là pre-tax IRA: không phải đóng thuế lúc bỏ vào (contribution) mà chỉ bị đóng thuế lúc lấy ra (distribution). Ngược lại Roth IRA/401k hay gọi là post tax:  tax free lúc lấy ra nhưng phải đóng thuế lúc bỏ vô. T để một nữa cho dễ hiểu, còn muốn tính cụ thể cái nào lợi hơn thì phụ thuộc vào nhiều yếu tố khác. 
4. Social Security and Medical Tax: 5,738 (7.65% of gross income), bắt buộc

**Lợi ích của những cái contributions ở trên:**

1. Pension: nếu làm liên tục 35 năm, lúc về hưu sẽ được lãnh 75% thu nhập của năm cao nhất. Giả sử lương cao nhất là 150k, 75% là 112,500.
2. Bảo hiểm sức khỏe miễn phí trọn đời nếu làm đủ 20 năm (cty trả)
3. Với return rate 5% trong 35 năm (pretty conservative + adjusment for inflation, chứ SP500 return rate trung bình là 10%), sẽ có 3M trong tài khoản hưu trí.
4. Lãnh khoảng 40k/year. Cái tiền Social Security này ít quá nên tao không tính cụ thể.

**Tax:** Người độc thân, standard deduction là 14,600 cho federal và 5,363 cho tiểu bang Cali. 

1. Federal income tax: taxable income (thu nhập bị đánh thuế) sẽ tính bằng gross income-standard deduction-pension-OPEB-traditional IRA sẽ là 37,900. Dựa theo federal tax bracket là sẽ đóng 4,316.
2. State income tax: Tương tự cách tính taxable income sẽ là 47,137. Dựa theo Cali tax bracket là sẽ đóng 1,452.
3. Vậy tổng số tiền **thuế** phải đóng là 5,768. Effective tax rate chỉ là 7.69%

**Net income**: = gross income-contributions-tax = **25,995**

**Expense: 1,500/tháng**

1. Nhà: share phòng 700
2. Ăn: 300
3. Xe cộ bảo hiểm: 400
4. Chi phí khác: 100

Với mức sống này nhiều thằng sẽ nghĩ tao sống bần tiện hay khổ, nhưng thực ra tao thấy rất thoải mái. Nếu tụi mày muốn ăn chơi nhiều hơn, hoặc có gia đình con cái thì bỏ vô quỹ hưu bớt lại.

**Quên nói thêm quyền lợi nữa:** 

1. bảo hiểm sức khỏe cộng dental insurance với vision insurance 1 tháng khoảng 1,000. Nhưng mà chỉ phải đóng $30, phần còn lại cty trả hết. Bảo hiểm rất tốt, low copay and low deductible. Một lần đi khám tốn vài chục đồng thôi, vợ cũng có thể ăn ké bảo hiểm của tao, đi đẻ không tốn đồng nào. Nói tí bảo hiểm của Mỹ nó tệ ở cái là chi phí  rất cao thôi, chứ dịch vụ với trình đô bác sĩ y ta mấy BV quốc tế bên VN đéo có cửa so. 
2. Một năm có 20 ngày paid time off + 11 paid holiday. Làm càng lâu thì còn đc nhiều hơn nữa.
3. Work life balance: Hybrid WFH 3 days/week. Tuần làm 40 tiếng. OT rất hiếm và nếu có thì đc trả 1.5. Hết giờ là tắt máy tắt diện thoại đéo có thằng sếp nào gọi. Rất là chill, nên nhưng đứa siêng thì nó còn làm thêm second job, side gigs kiếm thêm cả mớ. 

Một năm sẽ dư khoảng 8,000 để du lịch hay thích làm gì tùy m=)) fuck you money. Mà đó chỉ là mức lương thấp nhất mới ra trường. Chứ kĩ sư chỉ cần làm 3-4 năm là lên 100k.

 Làm 35 năm tới 60 tuổi nghĩ hưu có 3M trong tài khoản, tiền pension với SS một năm là khoảng 150k, mà lúc đó chỉ đóng thuế thôi chứ không còn phải contribute vô pension với SSI nữa, bảo hiểm thì free.

  
Còn kĩ sư bách khoa ở VN như thế nào thì nhờ tụi bay so sánh giùm.

Before, I thought graduates only needed to master professional knowledge, even prepare themselves for a starting salary of 10-12 million and have to work for 3-5 years to reach a management position. But I realized: the world out there doesn't just pay for academic knowledge, they pay for management and **reasoning** abilities. No matter how good an engineer is, if he only knows how to work independently and lacks coordination with the police party, his experience and compensation will only be at a limited level.

I submitted and tried many MTs with a starting salary of 24 million/month but in the end I chose sm or grab because this is where I use technical logical thinking to solve the operational problem of thousands of ~~people~~ orders. I'm the same age as everyone else, but I wear a blue uniform and dedicate myself to the freshness of the air.

Oh that's me from the past, now I'm working in Vietnam with a salary of 10-12 million, after deducting living expenses, I only have about 2 million left over per month. But when I was laid off, I decided to go to Japan to work. Currently, with a salary of 43 million, minus the cost of food, housing, and going out, there is still about $1,000 left over to save.

This is my perspective of having such an experience, just like you guys only listen to Japanese people talk and then report back. There's no culture for one company, everyone moves companies there.

# Why is violence in Vietnam inevitable? 

The main thing is growing dissatisfaction. If you still think that discontent is due to land theft, religious disagreement, and civil servants, then unfortunately that will not happen. But the conflict here comes from much larger causes, mainly revolving around three main factors: 

  
\- Deep economic and social dissatisfaction

* **economic recession:** If Vietnam's economy falls into a prolonged recession, leading to rising unemployment, high inflation and falling people's income, dissatisfaction will explode.
* **corruption is rampant:** if you can't eat big, then eat small and small. If we can uncover cases like Vietnam Asia, Lz's fake flight, and Truong My Lan, will we be able to uncover any other cases? Not to mention abolishing the death penalty for corruption =))? In general, to know how the economy is, just compare bank interest rates with USD to understand. 

\- political instability

* **infighting** and **lack of democracy** will be the two main causes. After coming to power, we can see a series of factions destroying each other along with a lack of democracy. Before the To Lam era, it was 331, but after that, do we still remember the traffic law with heavy penalties of x10? 

\- external influence

* **nepal**: the protest originated from the nepal government's decision to ban popular social networking platforms such as facebook, x (twitter) and youtube. However, the deeper cause is generation Z's dissatisfaction with corruption, ""nepo kids"" and high youth unemployment rate.
* **indonesia** :protests broke out in late August 2025 after it was reported that politicians received housing allowances of up to 3,000 USD, 10-20 times higher than the monthly minimum wage. this sparked anger about economic inequality and the extravagance of the ruling elite.
* **What about Vietnam**? suppression of freedom of expression, assembly, civil rights, inflation, rising cost of living, economic pressure, a series of scandalous events such as arrests, rising price inflation, x2 electricity prices, ban on gasoline cars, etc. In addition, we can see instability from the international environment, trade, tariffs, geopolitical instability, including administrative reform, restructuring of the state apparatus, consolidation of administrative units and policies. Adjust prices of public services and essential prices. 

#331 is just the beginning?

# Article 331 - Penal Code 2015 (amended 2017) Article 331 is considered by international human rights organizations that the concept of ""exploitation"" is very vague and easily abused to deal with dissenting voices, journalists, bloggers, and social activists.

* **full name**: *“abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.”*
* **main content**: criminal prosecution of people believed to have taken advantage of democratic freedoms to ""infringe"" on the interests of the state or others.
* **penalty range**: imprisonment from 6 months to 7 years (depending on severity).

# article 117 – Penal Code 2015 (amended 2017) This is considered one of the heaviest laws on information control and is criticized as restricting freedom of expression.

* **full name**: *“propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.”*
* **main content**: handling acts of ""making, storing, disseminating, propagating information and documents"" that are considered anti-state, with content that ""fabricates, causes confusion, and defames the government...""
* **penalty range**: can be up to 20 years in prison (depending on the severity and specific behavior).

# Decree 147/2024/ND-cp (often shortened to ""147"") - effective from 2025 

Many experts believe that this decree drastically reduces privacy and freedom online, easily becoming a surveillance tool.

* **full name**: decree on management of social network services and cross-border content services.
* **main content**:
   * Requires social networking platforms (facebook, tiktok, x/twitter...) to store user data in Vietnam.
   * request deletion of infringing content within 24 hours","Bạo Động ở VN sẽ là điều tất yếu ??

# Vì sao bạo động ở VN sẽ là điều tất yếu ? 

Chủ yêu là sự bất mãn ngày càng lớn. Nếu bọn mày vẫn nghĩ bất mãn do cướp đất, bất đồng tôn giáo, cán bộ cán dân thì rất tiếc điều đó sẽ không xảy ra. Nhưng mâu thuẩn ỏ đây đến từ những nguyên nhân lớn hơn nhiều chủ yếu sẽ xoay quanh 3 yếu tốt chính: 

  
\- Bất mãn sâu sắc về kinh tế và xã hội

* **Suy thoái kinh tế:** Nếu kinh tế Việt Nam rơi vào suy thoái kéo dài, dẫn đến thất nghiệp gia tăng, lạm phát cao và thu nhập của người dân giảm sút, thì sự bất mãn sẽ bùng nổ.
* **Tham nhũng tràn lan:** không ăn lớn được thì ăn nhỏ nhỏ ít ít lại. bọn m thấy khui ra được những vụ như việt á, chuyến bay xạo lz, trương mỹ lan thì có còn khui ra dc vụ nào nữa không ? chưa kể bỏ cả phạt tử hình đối vs tội tham nhũng =)) ? nói chung để biết dc kinh tế như thế nào là cứ so sánh lãi suất ngân hàng vs USD là hiểu. 

\- Sự bất ổn chính trị

* **Đấu đá nội** bộ và **Thiếu dân chủ** sẽ là 2 nguyên nhân chính. sau khi Tô Lâm lên bọn m có thể thấy được hàng loạt những phe phái triệt hạ lẫn nhau kèm thêm sự thiếu dân chủ. trước thời Tô Lâm thì 331 nhưng sau đó bọn m còn nhớ luật giao thông phạt nặng x10 ? 

\- Tác động từ bên ngoài

* **Nepal** :Cuộc biểu tình bắt nguồn từ quyết định của chính phủ Nepal cấm các nền tảng mạng xã hội phổ biến như Facebook, X (Twitter) và YouTube. Tuy nhiên, nguyên nhân sâu xa hơn là sự bất mãn của thế hệ Gen Z đối với tình trạng tham nhũng, nạn ""con ông cháu cha"" (nepo kids) và tỷ lệ thất nghiệp cao của giới trẻ.
* **Indonesia** :Các cuộc biểu tình bùng phát vào cuối tháng 8 năm 2025 sau khi có thông tin các chính trị gia nhận được khoản phụ cấp nhà ở lên tới 3.000 USD, cao gấp 10-20 lần mức lương tối thiểu hàng tháng. Điều này đã làm dấy lên sự tức giận về bất bình đẳng kinh tế và sự xa hoa của giới tinh hoa cầm quyền.
* **Vietnam thì sao** ? Sự đàn áp tự do biểu đạt, hội họp, quyền dân sự, lạm phát, giá cả sinh hoạt tăng, áp lực kinh tế, hàng loạt những sự kiện bê bối nổ ra như bắt giữ người, lạm phát giá cả tăng cao, giá tiền điện x2, cấm xe xăng,.... Ngoài ra bọn m có thể thấy thêm đó là sự bất ổn từ môi trường quốc tế ,thương mại, thuế quan, bất ổn địa chính trị thêm cả cải cách hành chính, sắp xếp lại bộ máy nhà nước, hợp nhất đơn vị hành chính, chính sách điều chỉnh giá các dịch vụ công, giá thiết yếu. 

# 331 chỉ là khởi đầu?

# Điều 331 – Bộ luật Hình sự 2015 (sửa đổi 2017) Điều 331 bị các tổ chức nhân quyền quốc tế cho rằng khái niệm “lợi dụng” rất mơ hồ, dễ bị lạm dụng để xử lý những tiếng nói bất đồng, nhà báo, blogger, nhà hoạt động xã hội.

* **Tên đầy đủ**: *“Lợi dụng các quyền tự do dân chủ xâm phạm lợi ích của Nhà nước, quyền, lợi ích hợp pháp của tổ chức, cá nhân.”*
* **Nội dung chính**: Truy cứu trách nhiệm hình sự đối với người bị cho là đã lợi dụng quyền tự do dân chủ để “xâm phạm” lợi ích Nhà nước hoặc người khác.
* **Khung hình phạt**: Phạt tù từ 6 tháng đến 7 năm (tùy mức độ).

# Điều 117 – Bộ luật Hình sự 2015 (sửa đổi 2017) Điều này được coi là một trong những điều luật nặng nhất về kiểm soát thông tin và bị phê phán là hạn chế quyền tự do biểu đạt.

* **Tên đầy đủ**: *“Tuyên truyền chống Nhà nước Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam.”*
* **Nội dung chính**: Xử lý những hành vi “làm, tàng trữ, phát tán, tuyên truyền thông tin, tài liệu” bị cho là chống Nhà nước, có nội dung “bịa đặt, gây hoang mang, phỉ báng chính quyền…”
* **Khung hình phạt**: Có thể lên tới 20 năm tù (tùy mức độ và hành vi cụ thể).

# Nghị định 147/2024/NĐ-CP (thường gọi ngắn là “147”)  – có hiệu lực từ 2025 

Nhiều chuyên gia cho rằng nghị định này làm giảm mạnh quyền riêng tư và tự do trên mạng, dễ trở thành công cụ giám sát.

* **Tên đầy đủ**: Nghị định quản lý dịch vụ mạng xã hội, dịch vụ nội dung xuyên biên giới.
* **Nội dung chính**:
   * Yêu cầu nền tảng mạng xã hội (Facebook, TikTok, X/Twitter…) phải lưu trữ dữ liệu người dùng tại Việt Nam.
   * Yêu cầu xóa nội dung vi phạm trong vòng 24 giờ theo yêu cầu của cơ quan quản lý.
   * Bắt buộc người dùng xác thực tài khoản bằng thông tin cá nhân (CMND/CCCD/điện thoại).
   * Tăng mức phạt và quy định xử lý chặt chẽ hơn với các nền tảng nước ngoài.

# Sửa đổi Hiến pháp / Hiến pháp bổ sung, sửa đổi

* **Nghị quyết số 203/2025/QH15**: được Quốc hội thông qua ngày 16/6/2025, sửa đổi và bổ sung một số điều của Hiến pháp 2013. (Nguồn: [xaydungchinhsach.chinhphu.vn](https://xaydungchinhsach.chinhphu.vn/nghi-quyet-203-2025-qh15-sua-doi-bo-sung-mot-so-dieu-cua-hien-phap-nuoc-cong-hoa-xa-hoi-chu-nghia-viet-nam-119250616181735552.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Các điểm đáng chú ý**:
   * Điều chỉnh, hợp nhất hoặc bổ sung các quy định về tổ chức bộ máy nhà nước, tăng quyền hạn cho một số cơ quan hành pháp trong quản lý kinh tế – xã hội.
   * Bổ sung điều khoản về chuyển đổi số, an ninh mạng và quản lý dữ liệu công dân, đặt nền tảng pháp lý cho các nghị định như 147.
   * Điều chỉnh quy định về đất đai, tài nguyên, có thể ảnh hưởng tới quyền sở hữu và sử dụng của người dân và doanh nghiệp.
   * Một số quy định mới về trách nhiệm công dân và nghĩa vụ báo cáo/tham gia hệ thống dữ liệu quốc gia.
* **Tác động xã hội**:
   * Nếu các sửa đổi này được hiểu là tăng quyền kiểm soát của Nhà nước hoặc thu hẹp phạm vi tự do cá nhân, có thể gây tâm lý lo ngại trong xã hội.
   * Các nhóm có quan điểm bất đồng hoặc hoạt động xã hội dân sự có thể coi đây là dấu hiệu “thắt chặt” thay vì “mở rộng” nên phản ứng, nhất là trên mạng xã hội.
   * Ngược lại, nếu công khai minh bạch, giải thích rõ ràng và cho phép phản biện công khai, có thể giảm căng thẳng và củng cố niềm tin xã hội.

Because after a while, it seemed like they were all southern brothers. Personally, I have been a dissatisfied and anti-indoctrinationist in the North for more than 10 years since I graduated. He also endured a lot of discrimination from both family and work, had to change jobs a lot and gradually refrained from expressing arbitrary opinions.  
I want to ask if there are many guys in here, around my age (over 30) or 2x is fine. Over the years, I saw many brothers and sisters who were upset and understood but in the end they didn't get there, but they still rekindled their faith a bit because history was learned in their brains from a young age. Out here, many dissatisfied people mostly keep it to themselves or sometimes accept to go with the flow because there is no other way.   
  
The generation that writes blogs, takes to the streets to express opinions, and writes newspapers is now old and far away, including both black and white, lying in hiding, submitting and maintaining independence. My generation is just a witness and silently follows, and there are only very few people who write famous articles online. Personally, I just want a republic where people are free to express their opinions, with minimal legal defense, with humane education and teaching people to respect each other and respect the truth from a young age, without exaggeration, without grandiosity, as long as today is better than yesterday, there is no need to be superior or a brilliant pinnacle...  
  
Russia and China are dictatorial and have strong control, but the West is not innocent because among the elite there are many people who want to reduce the population and increase social control. But anyway, there people still have the right to speak up, and have the opportunity to express and criticize ten thousand times easier.  
  
Well, in short, in the near future there will be many policies imposed with the tendency to oppress and suffocate society, so I want to know if that will suddenly wake up everyone out here? hehe","Trong đây có anh em nào miền Bắc không? Như tiêu đề, chỉ là muốn hỏi xem có nhiều ae miền Bắc trong này không để nắm tình hình thôi. Vì lướt qua một thời gian thấy hình như toàn anh em miền Nam. Cá nhân tôi là người bất mãn và chống nhồi sọ ở miền Bắc cũng được hơn 10 năm rồi từ hồi ra trường. Cũng chịu đựng nhiều sự kỳ thị từ cả gia đình đến nơi làm việc, phải chuyển việc nhiều và dần dần giữ ý không thể hiện quan điểm tuỳ tiện.  
Muốn hỏi xem có nhiều anh em trong này, tầm tuổi tôi (ngoài 30) hoặc 2x cũng được. Qua năm tháng thấy có nhiều người anh, chị và em bức xúc, cũng hiểu chuyện nhưng rốt cuộc không đến nơi đến chốn vẫn nhen nhóm tin một chút vì lịch sử được học hằn vào não từ bé. Ngoài này nhiều người bất mãn đa phần giữ trong lòng hoặc nhiều khi chấp nhận xuôi theo dòng vì chẳng còn cách nào khác.   
  
Thế hệ viết blog, xuống đường biểu tình nêu ý kiến quan điểm, viết báo giờ đều già và ở xa, trong đó có cả trắng đen nằm vùng, quy phục và giữ vững độc lập. Thế hệ mình chỉ là người chứng kiến rồi âm thầm theo dõi và gần như chỉ có rất ít người có viết bài có tiếng trên mạng. Cá nhân mình chỉ mong muốn một nền cộng hoà, nơi người dân được tự do biểu đạt ý kiến, được pháp luật bảo vệ tối thiểu điều đó, với một nền giáo dục nhân bản và dạy con người ta tôn trọng nhau tôn trọng sự thật từ nhỏ, không phóng đại, không vĩ cuồng, chỉ cần hôm nay tốt hơn hôm qua chứ éo cần phải ưu việt đỉnh cao chói lọi...  
  
Nga Tàu thì độc tài và kiểm soát mạnh, phương Tây thì cũng chẳng vô tội vì trong giới tinh hoa có nhiều kẻ muốn giảm dân số và gia tăng kiểm soát xã hội. Nhưng dù sao ở đó người dân vẫn có quyền được lên tiếng, và có cơ hội biểu đạt, chỉ trích dễ dàng hơn gấp vạn lần.

1bll3m7,1711173370.0,2024-03-23 05:56:10,"The reason why most people who only ""study well"" in Vietnam later in life cannot do anything well. ""The chemistry of Vietnamese education is to spend 5-6 years studying chemistry but never prepare, extract or know how to produce any useful chemicals. This is called pretending to learn a fake chemistry, like fake chemistry.

*This is added by me because there are 1-2 comments saying: studying for 12 years is learning the ""foundation"" ""muscles"" ""learning how to play"" until you go to university/graduate school to study in depth. Then we can prepare, invent, xyz... something. 

But the above passage says that ""a student who studied chemistry from grade 6 to 12 spent 7 years but could not prepare, extract or produce any useful chemicals"" but if a student studied chemistry for 7 years and could do that, that's okay, right? Why do you have to go to graduate school to get a job?

Reading it, it sounds reasonable, but it's not very related to the above paragraph, it can't prove that it's wrong, and it even claims that the author of the article is a high school student😅
*continue article:

It's the same as learning English from grade 3 to 12 but not being able to talk to foreigners, watching English movies without subtitles and not being able to understand, not being able to read English books, but what's the point in studying for 9 years while other people study in 6 months to 3 years to master it. This is called learning fake English, a type of English from the Ministry of Education and Training that cannot be used in reality, but students and teachers have to have the illusion that after learning it, they can use it. You have to be so paranoid that you accept and admit that it's true, you have to brainwash yourself so you can go to extra classes, practice for English exams, practice for chemistry exams, and practice for physics exams. And you have to be very crazy and paranoid to think that by practicing a lot of these things and getting high scores in exams, you are truly good at math, physics, chemistry, or English. 

not just teaching fake knowledge that cannot be used in practice or reality. The school, parents and teachers also train 15-18 year olds to practice paranoia, thinking fake is real.  Have you ever planned to do something, but your conscience or conscience or some subconscious told you not to do it because it was quite stupid, but you still did it and ended up doing it, somehow blaming yourself for suddenly doing it even though you had a gut feeling that it wasn't right? That's it, many people have the intuition that learning these three nonsense things will never be applicable in life but still rush to study, even get infected, investing time and effort to ""practice"" to get the highest score of an useless program. 

From being paranoid that this is a valuable learning program, they become more paranoid by thinking of themselves as a top ranking warrior. They work so hard to prepare for the exam that they pass as valedictorian with perfect scores in fake math, fake physics, fake chemistry, fake English... then after 5-10 years they wake up and realize that they wasted 3 years from 15 to 18 years old playing a stupid game, wasting time on knowledge that they can never use in life, but when they were young, they were taught by their parents and groups of workers that it's true, it's something that will help you go far in society, so they regret it. because he played that game so seriously, so seriously that he was ranked top because he practiced every day in that stupid game.

""Hóa học của giáo dục VN là dành 5-6 năm trời học hoá nhưng không bao giờ bào chế, chiết xuất hay biết cách sản xuất bất kì hoá chất gì hữu dụng . Đây gọi là giả bộ học một loại hoá học giả, kiểu như fake chemistry.

*Cái này là do t thêm vào vì có 1-2 cmt nói rằng: học 12 năm là học cái ""nền tảng"" ""cơ bẻn"" ""học chơi chơi cho biết"" đến khi học đại học/cao học mới học chuyên sâu. Thì mới bào chế, phát minh, xyz... gì đó dc. 

Nhưng đoạn văn trên nói rằng ""1 hs học hóa từ lớp 6 đến 12 là 7 năm nhưng ko thể Bào chế, chiết xuất hay sản xuất 1 hóa chất hữu dụng nào"" NHƯNG 1 hs học hóa 7 năm mà làm dc như vậy thì cũng bth mà? Mắc gì phải cao học mới làm ra được?

Đọc qua nghe có vẻ có lí nhưng nó ko liên quan lắm đến đoạn trên, cũng ko chứng minh dc là nó sai và còn chụp mũ chủ bài viết là hs cấp3 nữa😅
*Tiếp tục bài viết:

Nó cũng giống hệt như học tiếng Anh từ lớp 3 đến lớp 12 mà không nói chuyện được với người nước ngoài, xem phim tiếng anh không có phụ đề sẽ không hiểu, sách tiếng anh thì không đọc được mà học quần què gì học 9 năm trời trong khi người ta học 6 tháng đến 3 năm là thuần thục. Đây gọi là học fake english, một loại tiếng anh của bộ giáo dục và đào tạo không xài được trong thực tế nhưng học sinh, giáo viên phải ảo tưởng rằng học xong có thể dùng được. Phải hoang tưởng đến độ chấp nhận và thừa nhận nó đúng, phải tẩy não chính mình để mà có thể đi học thêm, đi luyện thi tiếng anh, luyện thi hoá, luyện thi vật lý. Và phải cuồng râm sinh hoang tưởng lắm mới nghĩ rằng đi luyện thật nhiều mấy cái này, đi thi được điểm cao mới là thật sự giỏi toán, vật lý, hoá, hoặc anh văn. 

Không chỉ dạy kiến thức kiểu fake không dùng được trong thực tế hay hiện thực. Nhà trường, bố mẹ và các thợ dạy còn huấn luyện cho mấy đứa 15-18 tuổi tập tính hoang tưởng, nghĩ giả là thật.  Có bao giờ bạn tính làm một chuyện, mà conscience hay lương tâm hay cái tiềm thức nào đó bảo bạn đừng làm vì nó khá ngu, nhưng bạn vẫn làm rồi ăn hành, sao đó tự trách mình tự nhiên đi làm chuyện đó dù đã có linh tính là nó không ổn không? Đấy là nó đó, nhiều người đã có linh tính học ba cái vớ vẩn này sẽ không bao giờ ứng dụng được trong cuộc sống nhưng vẫn lao đầu đi học, thậm chí bị nhiễm, đầu tư thời gian công sức để  ""luyện"" cho được điểm cao nhất của một cái chương trình không dùng được. 

Từ việc hoang tưởng đây là một chương trình học có giá trị, họ hoang tưởng nặng hơn bằng cách nghĩ mình là một chiến binh cày top. Họ cày điên cuồng luyện thi đến mức đậu thủ khoa bằng điểm tuyệt đối các môn fake math, fake physic, fake chemistry, fake english... Rồi 5-10 năm sao họ tỉnh lại họ nhận ra đã phí 3 năm từ 15 đến 18 tuổi để chơi một cái trò ngu bò, phí thời gian cho những kiến thức mà họ không bao giờ dùng được trong cuộc sống nhưng mà lúc còn trẻ dại họ bị bố mẹ và các nhóm thợ dạy bảo đấy là thực đấy là thứ sẽ giúp bạn tiến xa trong xã hội nên họ tiếc vì chơi cái trò ấy quá nghiêm túc, nghiêm túc đến mức được top vì luyện thi mỗi ngày trong cái trò chơi ngôn lù ấy.

I have a question and need advice. Suppose I marry a 19–22 year old female, but she is still in college/university. So who will take care of tuition and study expenses (books, extra classes, internships...)?

I think:
	• Tuition and school fees are the responsibility of parents to take care of their children until they graduate. They cannot ""transfer"" everything to their husband after getting married.
	• Husbands should only take care of married life (eating, traveling, living together, taking care of...).
	• If your husband supports tuition, it is voluntary, not an obligation.

But my mother said that ""when we get married, the husband has to take care of everything, including the wife's education."" I find this unfair, because learning is the responsibility of parents from the beginning.

According to everyone, in Vietnam, which viewpoint is more correct and fair? Has anyone ever been in this situation please share with me.

Thank you everyone!","Sau khi kết hôn, ai nên lo chi phí học tập của vợ nếu vợ còn đang đi học? Chào mọi người, mình là nam, 28 tuổi.

Mình có một thắc mắc cần lời khuyên. Giả sử mình kết hôn với một bạn nữ 19–22 tuổi, nhưng bạn ấy vẫn còn đang đi học đại học/cao đẳng. Vậy thì chuyện học phí, chi phí học tập (sách vở, học thêm, thực tập…) sẽ do ai lo?

Mình nghĩ rằng:
	•	Học phí và việc học vốn là trách nhiệm cha mẹ lo cho con cho đến khi ra trường, không thể vì cưới rồi mà “chuyển giao” hết cho chồng.
	•	Chồng chỉ nên lo phần đời sống vợ chồng (ăn uống, đi lại, sinh hoạt chung, chăm sóc…).
	•	Nếu chồng có hỗ trợ học phí thì đó là tự nguyện, chứ không phải nghĩa vụ.

Nhưng mẹ mình lại nói rằng “khi cưới về thì chồng phải lo hết, kể cả chuyện học của vợ”. Mình thấy điều này không công bằng, vì việc học thuộc trách nhiệm cha mẹ ngay từ đầu.

Theo mọi người, ở Việt Nam thì quan điểm nào đúng và công bằng hơn? Có ai từng ở trong tình huống này chia sẻ cho mình với.

1nwnscw,1759459952.0,2025-10-03 02:52:32,"a failure of strength 
The ancients had a saying for monarchs: ""One word, the world will be buried; one word, the world will be prosperous"". That means that when heads of state represent a country, when they go out, sometimes their careless statement accidentally brings down the whole country; But there are also things they say that make their country prosperous and strong.

I just re-listened to the speech of Vietnam's President Luong Cuong online, on the occasion of his visit to the United Nations council meeting in the US. On my subjective side, in addition to the grammatical mistake in the way he addressed him and often using the phrase ""we"" as an ungainly command, what he made a serious mistake was also in the content of his speech. 

Three mistakes in the content of his speech that made President Trump angry and displeased, giving him the basis and basis to raise the latest tax rate to apply to Vietnam are:

1. Mr. Luong Duong believes that the conflicts and conflicts in the world today are caused by big countries: he does not dare to say which country, but Trump can be understood as implicitly referring to his name, to the United States regarding tax policy... 

2. Luong Cuong, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, declared his support for recognition of the Palestinian state; On the contrary, Trump sees this recognition as a reward for the Hamas terrorist force.

3. He does not have a great position, yet he dares to stand up and call for the US to lift the embargo and sanctions against Cuba, and remove Cuba from the list of sponsors of terrorism. No different from him voluntarily speaking out in support of the dictatorship and one-party regime like in Vietnam. This made Trump feel like they were all on the same team; ""an ox seeks an ox; a horse seeks a horse"" to link together with China standing side by side, shoulder to shoulder against us...

It's true that ""if you say a word like that, you'll be buried"". Just because no one wanted to listen to the endless speech he read. Everyone in the hall went out to drink water. But because of the ""blasphemous"" content, Trump cannot ignore it.

Because of tit for tat, on September 26, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced the application of import tariffs on a series of products, including many key and important export products of Vietnam:

- Branded drugs: 100% tax.
- Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities: 50% tax.
- Upholstered furniture: 30% tax.
- Heavy trucks: 25% tax.
- Wooden products: 50% tax.

and many other taxes.

Yes, Cuong just spoke indiscriminately because of his own self-indulgence, not knowing who he was, so he confronted America to harm his people and his country. The United Nations is not a forum for you to exhort and call for ""us"" to be united into a dictatorial faction, together against American and Western democracy.

I think that the person who composed this speech for Luong Cuong to read is not qualified, has not read, is uneducated and cannot update current news.; But the strong force still deliberately followed it, refusing to omit the harmful elements and making it even worse, so in the end our people suffered many blows because of the stupid ""king"". Cuong is really crazy, that's all he should know about the Cuban issue, instead of revealing his shirt and digging up dirt to show people his back; but that person is trump, a real guy!

In my opinion, as long as the government in Vietnam is not legitimate - meaning it is not elected by the people like in a democratic system, it should not show its face abroad. So embarrassed and humiliated! You should sit at home to let it heal; but our people also avoid being ""injustified by bondholders"".

cre : Nguyen doan don","Một thất bại của Lương Cường 
Người xưa có câu dành cho những bậc quân vương là: ""Nhất ngôn xử thế táng Bang; Nhất ngôn xử thế hưng Bang"" . Điều đó có nghĩa là những bậc Nguyên thủ đại diện cho một Quốc gia khi đi ra ngoài thì có khi do một câu phát ngôn thiếu cẩn trọng của họ cũng vô tình  làm lụn bại cho cả Đất nước; nhưng cũng có câu của họ nói ra lại làm cho Đất nước của họ được hưng thịnh và vững mạnh lên.

Tôi vừa nghe lại bài phát biểu của Chủ tịch nước VN là  Lương Cường trên mạng, nhân dịp anh ta sang dự phiên họp Hội đồng liên hiệp quốc tại Mỹ. Về phía chủ quan của tôi thấy ngoài sự sai lầm về văn phạm trong cách thưa gửi và hay dùng cụm từ hô hào ""chúng ta"" như một mệnh lệnh vô duyên ra, thì cái điều anh ta đã phạm sai lầm  nghiêm trọng còn cả về  nội dung bài phát biểu nữa. 

Ba sai lầm trong bài diễn văn về nội dung mà anh đã làm cho Tổng thống Trump tức và phật ý, để ông có căn cứ và cơ sở nâng mức thuế mới nhất để áp dụng cho VN là :

1. Anh  Lương Cường cho rằng những xung đột và mẫu thuẫn trên Thế giới hiện nay là do những nước lớn: Anh không dám nói rõ nước nào, nhưng Trump có thể hiểu là ngầm chỉ đến tên ông ta, đến nước Mỹ  về chính sách thuế khóa... 

2. Lương Cường thay mặt Nhân dân VN tuyên bố ủng hộ công nhận Nhà nước Palestin; mà trái lại Trump cho sự công nhận này là phần thưởng cho lực lượng khủng bố Hamas.

3. Anh ta chả có địa vị gì to tát, mà dám đứng lên kêu gọi Mỹ phải dỡ bỏ cấm vận và các lệnh trừng phạt với Cuba, đưa Cuba ra khỏi danh sách các đối tượng tài trợ bọn khủng bố. Khác gì anh tự nguyện lên tiếng ủng hộ chế độ độc tài, độc đảng như ở VN. Điều này anh đã khiến Trump đọc được vị ngay là bầy cùng một duộc; ""ngưu tầm ngưu; mã tầm mã"" để liên kết với nhau cùng với TQ sát cánh, kề vai chống lại mình...

Đúng là ""nhất ngôn xử thế TÁNG BANG"". Chỉ vì bài diễn văn thao thao bất tuyệt đọc lên chả ai thèm nghe. Cả Hội trường người ta bỏ ra ngoài uống nước cả. Nhưng vì nội dung ""phạm thượng"", nên Trump theo dõi không thể bỏ qua.

Chính vì ăn miếng, trả miếng mà vào ngày 26 tháng 9 năm 2025, Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump đã thông báo áp dụng các mức thuế nhập khẩu đối với một loạt sản phẩm, trong đó có nhiều mặt hàng xuất khẩu chủ lực, quan trọng của Việt Nam là:

- Thuốc có thương hiệu: Áp thuế 100%.
- Tủ bếp và bàn trang điểm phòng tắm: Áp thuế 50%.
- Đồ nội thất có bọc đệm: Áp thuế 30%.
- Xe tải hạng nặng: Áp thuế 25%.
- Mặt hàng gỗ: Áp thuế 50%.

Và nhiều thứ thuế khác nữa.

Vâng, anh Cường chỉ vì tự sướng cứ thích lên là phát ngôn bừa bãi, không biết mình là ai, nên đã đối đầu với Mỹ để hại Đồng bào mình, Đất nước mình. Liên Hiệp Quốc không phải là diễn đàn để anh lên hô hào, kêu gọi  liên kết ""chúng ta"" thành bè phái độc tài, cùng nhau chống lại nền dân chủ Mỹ và phương tây.

Tôi cho rằng người soạn bài diễn văn này cho Lương Cường đọc là không đủ trình độ, ít đọc, ít học và không cập nhật được tin thời sự.; mà Lương Cường vẫn cứ cố tình đọc theo, không chịu lược bỏ đi những yếu tố nguy hại lại càng kém nữa, thành thử cuối cùng dân ta vì ""quân vương"" ngu mà lãnh đủ đòn. Cường thật là dở hơi, vấn đề Cuba thì chỉ nên biết vậy thôi, chứ lại đi vạch áo, bới móc cho người xem lưng; mà người đó lại là Trump, là ng* đích thực rồi!

Theo tôi chừng nào Chính phủ ở VN chưa chính danh-Nghĩa là không do Dân bầu lên như ở Thể chế dân chủ, thì không nên vác mặt ra nước ngoài làm gì. Xấu hổ và nhục lắm! Các vị nên ngồi nhà cho nó lành; mà người dân chúng tôi cũng đỡ bị ""oan gia trái chủ"".

1q7l67y,1767900089.0,2026-01-08 19:21:29,"From elementary school to the end of high school, I had almost no friends and was isolated. Now I just want to have a true friend. I'll be honest, from elementary school to the end of high school, I almost didn't have any true friends. Maybe that's why I was introverted from a very early age, and at that time I didn't know I had ASD or anything, I just knew I was different from them.

My level 1 is still fine. Study well, sometimes even be a good student. I still have friends, and when I invite them for a birthday, they still go. At that time everything was normal.

But when I reach middle school, it starts to get worse. Most of my old friends don't go to the same school anymore. They say they go to this school and that school, but in reality they go to each other's own place. I stayed behind and had to study with a group of complete strangers.

My personality is gentle and honest, my family has pampered me since childhood. Academic performance at that time was only good to average, not as good as before. And in true school social fashion, when they see that I'm kind, they attack.

pen was taken.

hidden utensils.

Sometimes I even lose my Casio calculator.

One time, because there were too many things missing in class, the supervisor stopped the whole class and checked each briefcase. I didn't point anyone out, nor did I make a big deal out of it, but after that time, I started to feel clearly that they hated me. I suspect they thought I was the reason the whole class was tested, even though I was also the one who lost things.

The most painful thing is that the kids who have studied with me since elementary school also followed suit. From acquaintance, they turned to slander and backstabbing. At that time, I was gentle and stupid, wherever I went, I ate and drank, thinking that if I lived well, people would love me back. but no, the result is more foul play.

After a few conflicts, they boycotted me and then spread to other classes. I became a truly isolated person.

When I entered high school, my academic performance was only average, and sometimes I had to retake the exam to be promoted. I study near home, and I've seen a few old elementary school friends, but they hardly remember me anymore. I also don't care.

What I remember most clearly in high school is the feeling of being called names, reading scores publicly in front of the class, in front of parents, and being considered a weak student. I admit that back then I also had my shortcomings, for example being explosive and showing off, but I gave up on those things a long time ago.

During all my years of high school, I didn't hang out with anyone. I don't care if I'm ostracized or looked down upon. I only have one thought in mind: get out of that educational environment as soon as possible, go out and do something.

Now I'm living in Saigon. No stable job yet, still at home and supported by family. I don't write this article to ask for pity or to play the victim.

I just want to say frankly:

I want to have a real friend, real life, respect each other and support each other in life.

If so, I appreciate it. If not, then I'm grateful for at least reading this far.

And I want to ask more:

Has anyone been in the same situation as me?

Have you ever been looked down upon by them just because you're kind, because you're different, because you didn't know how to resist when you were in school?

Ever lost things, been misunderstood, and ended up being hated and isolated?

If so, I'd like to hear it. Not to compare suffering, but to know that I'm not the only one who has been buried like that.

Thank you for reading.","Từ cấp 1 tới hết cấp 3 tao gần như không có bạn, bị cô lập, giờ chỉ mong có một người bạn thật lòng Tao nói thiệt, từ cấp 1 cho tới hết cấp 3, tao gần như đéo có một đứa bạn nào gọi là thân đúng nghĩa. Có lẽ vì vậy mà tính tao hướng nội từ rất sớm, mà hồi đó tao cũng không biết mình bị ASD hay gì hết, chỉ biết là mình khác tụi nó.

Cấp 1 của tao thì còn ổn. Học hành đàng hoàng, có lúc còn là học sinh giỏi. Bạn bè vẫn có, sinh nhật mời là tụi nó vẫn đi đầy đủ. Lúc đó mọi thứ còn bình thường.

Nhưng lên cấp 2 là bắt đầu nát. Đa số mấy đứa bạn cũ không học chung trường nữa. Tụi nó nói là qua trường này trường kia, nhưng thực tế là mỗi đứa một nơi. Tao ở lại, phải học với một đám hoàn toàn xa lạ.

Tính tao thì hiền, thật thà, gia đình lại nuông chiều từ nhỏ. Học lực lúc đó chỉ ở mức khá với trung bình, không còn giỏi như trước. Và đúng kiểu xã hội học đường, thấy tao hiền là tụi nó lấn tới.

Bút viết bị lấy.

Đồ dùng bị giấu.

Có lúc mất luôn cả máy tính Casio.

Có một lần vì trong lớp mất đồ nhiều quá, ông thầy giám thị chặn cả lớp lại, kiểm tra từng cặp táp. Tao không chỉ mặt đứa nào, cũng không làm lớn chuyện, nhưng từ sau lần đó, tao bắt đầu cảm nhận rõ là tụi nó ghét tao. Tao nghi tụi nó nghĩ tao là nguyên nhân khiến cả lớp bị kiểm tra, dù tao cũng là người bị mất đồ.

Cái đau nhất là mấy đứa từng học chung với tao từ cấp 1 cũng hùa theo. Từ chỗ quen biết, tụi nó quay sang nói xấu, đâm sau lưng. Tao thì lúc đó hiền, cũng ngu, đi đâu ăn uống gì cũng hay bao, nghĩ là sống tốt thì người ta thương lại. Nhưng không, kết quả là bị chơi xấu nhiều hơn.

Sau vài chuyện xích mích, tụi nó tẩy chay tao luôn, rồi còn lan qua mấy lớp khác. Tao thành đứa bị cô lập đúng nghĩa.

Lên cấp 3 thì học lực tao chỉ còn trung bình, có lúc còn phải thi lại mới được lên lớp. Tao học gần nhà, có gặp lại vài đứa bạn cấp 1 cũ nhưng tụi nó hầu như không nhớ tao nữa. Tao cũng không quan tâm.

Cái tao nhớ rõ nhất ở cấp 3 là cảm giác bị bêu tên, đọc điểm công khai trước lớp, trước phụ huynh, bị xem như thằng học sinh yếu kém. Tao thừa nhận hồi đó tao cũng có khuyết điểm, ví dụ hay nổ, hay khoe, nhưng mấy cái đó tao bỏ lâu rồi.

Suốt cả mấy năm cấp 3, tao đéo chơi với ai hết. Bị tẩy chay, bị coi thường, tao cũng kệ. Tao chỉ có một suy nghĩ trong đầu: thoát khỏi cái môi trường giáo dục đó càng sớm càng tốt, đi ra ngoài làm cái gì đó còn hơn.

Giờ tao đang sống ở Sài Gòn. Chưa có công việc ổn định, vẫn đang ở nhà và được gia đình hỗ trợ. Tao viết bài này không phải để xin thương hại hay đóng vai nạn nhân.

Tao chỉ muốn nói thẳng:

tao muốn có một người bạn chơi thật, sống thật, tôn trọng nhau và hỗ trợ nhau trong cuộc sống.

Có thì tao trân trọng, không có thì tao cũng cảm ơn vì ít nhất đã đọc tới đây.

Và tao muốn hỏi thêm:

Có ai từng giống hoàn cảnh của tao không?

Từng bị tụi nó coi thường chỉ vì hiền, vì khác, vì không biết phản kháng lúc còn đi học?

Từng bị mất đồ, bị hiểu lầm, rồi cuối cùng thành ra bị ghét và bị cô lập luôn?

Nếu có thì tao muốn nghe. Không phải để so khổ, mà để biết là không phải chỉ có mình tao từng bị vùi như vậy.

Cảm ơn tụi mày đã đọc.","from elementary school end high school , i have almost no friend isolate . now i just want have a true friend . i'll honest , from elementary school end high school , i almost didn't have any true friend . maybe that's why i introvert from a very early age , time i didn't know i have asd anything , i just know i different from them . my level 1 still fine . study well , sometimes even a good student . i still have friend , when i invite them a birthday , they still go . time everything normal . when i reach middle school , start get bad . most my old friend don't go same school anymore . they say they go school school , reality they go each other's own place . i stay behind have study a group complete stranger . my personality gentle honest , my family have pamper me since childhood . academic performance time only good average , not good a before . true school social fashion , when they see i'm kind , they attack . pen take . hidden utensil . sometimes i even lose my casio calculator . one time , because there too many thing miss class , supervisor stop whole class check each briefcase . i didn't point anyone out , nor do i make a big deal out , after time , i start feel clearly they hat me . i suspect they think i reason whole class test , even though i also one who lose thing . most painful thing kid who have study me since elementary school also follow suit . from acquaintance , they turn slander backstabbing . time , i gentle stupid , wherever i go , i ate drank , think if i live well , people would love me back . no , result more foul play . after a few conflict , they boycott me then spread other class . i become a truly isolated person . when i enter high school , my academic performance only average , sometimes i have retake exam promote . i study near home , i've see a few old elementary school friend , they hardly remember me anymore . i also don't care . what i remember most clearly high school feeling call name , read score publicly front class , front parent , consider a weak student . i admit back then i also have my shortcoming , example explosive show off , i give up those thing a long time ago . during all my year high school , i didn't hang out anyone . i don't care if i'm ostracize look down upon . i only have one think mind : get out educational environment soon a possible , go out do something . now i'm living saigon . no stable job yet , still home support family . i don't write article ask pity play victim . i just want say frankly : i want have a real friend , real life , respect each other support each other life . if , i appreciate . if not , then i'm grateful least read far . i want ask more : have anyone same situation a me ? have you ever look down upon them just because you're kind , because you're different , because you didn't know how resist when you school ? ever lose thing , misunderstood , end up hat isolate ? if , i'd like hear . not compare suffering , know i'm not only one who have bury like . thank you read .",Depression

15z67wl,1692802568.0,2023-08-23 14:56:08,"The gen z generation now sees almost nothing save tl;dr I'm a gen z and I feel that the **vast majority** of gen z - the core force of the country in the future that I observe around me both online and in real life are very broken, indifferent and see everything around them as rosy

Hello elders in the sub, I don't know where to start, but the feeling is too frustrating and I can't share it with gen z and many people around me. Saying it out means being labeled as a bully (???), so I can only write it on this subreddit. Even if my sentences are too confusing, I hope you guys will sympathize with me. It's been almost 2 or 3 months now.

A little bit about my background: graduated from a talented class with a top 5 GPA at a school in VNU-HCM majoring in IT, worked from the end of my 2nd year for the top product companies in Singapore today, my entire family is registered in Saigon, middle class, in general, I have a life enough to take care of many things, play and destroy things, like to enjoy like Gen Z

In short, I'm quite confident that I belong to the gen z elite class of my age. It's just that whether I like it or not, I've been discouraged by it, even though I used to be very proud of it like when I was fighting the epidemic.

....

Everything starts from me being aware of the misery of nvqs. If they are truly trained and trained to become better and more methodical like Korea, then I consider it truly an obligation... but at this level, it's really just a market economy.

I don't say anything about doing it according to the law, but I live in a central district of Ho Chi Minh City and I realize how miserable this is. The paperwork and money go up to 100 million for the first year even though I'm nearly 6.75 degrees and 1 degree confused.

Whoever said I was bewitched or lured, but the district I live in had a 7-degree riot and 3-degree riot and it was gone (not a militia) -&gt; I told this video to many friends around me and they all said ""my family is big, we have to worry about everything"" and they went away to play games.

Then there are 7,749 cases that I realized, such as:

\+ Tax settlement is still pending, tax refund is late for Samsung -&gt; self-destruct fdi, economics

\+ public service page for applying for criminal records to work, passport -&gt; administrative such as menstruation, information technology 0.4

\+ the case of the rescue flight, Vietnam and Asia are not handled, the medical students are pretending -&gt; medical

\+ bhxh -&gt; social security

\+ After shooting the wrong goat, comcom posted a stupid article -&gt; security and order

\+ valedictorian failed university, everyone's score was 28 29 30 -&gt; education

\+ the press confuses words -&gt; freedom of speech, white for black, loss of integrity

\+ All kinds of regulations and documents such as law on civil defense, fraud, and startups are all lies to the people -&gt; kills internal development

\+ embezzlement, corruption -&gt; gap between rich and poor

\+ 3️⃣3️⃣1️⃣

....

There are many other cases, but what I get back from gen Z people my age around me are reactionary guys, stupid guys, who don't care.

""I don't think it has any impact, it has nothing to do with me so I don't care"" - the words of a guy who has never done tax finalization, cares about social insurance, and has his parents take care of his obligations from a to z.

""Maybe if guys like /r tclt come up, the country will be better""

The other said: ""My family comes from a big family, we take care of everything, don't be afraid, do you know who your father is?""

Needless to say, the girls around and even on Tinder... no matter how much I fantasized before, to them, no matter how intense the rescue flight case was, it was just like ""the law has been enforced"", no matter how many mass layoffs, in the end, the stories they posted or in their minds were simply jerky screenshots, showing off breasts and butts, checking in to concerts,

Moreover, they all learn marketing and photoshop but don't know how to chat, who is dominating, when they do that, dozens of people are born.

After graduating, I checked in, took pictures, posted articles, shouted loudly, then forgot that I had an average/good degree and was still unemployed/earning 50% salary/being treated like a dog.

1m3vuul,1752930563.0,2025-07-19 13:09:23,"A ""patriotic"" international student in Japan, bitter in hopelessness after the merger, mentioned that the reason for Song Thanh's decision to pursue the goal of becoming a cancer research scientist came from her parents' work as a doctor. Thanh shared: ""My father is a hepatologist and my mother is a dentist. My father told me that stem cells are a promising field in the future that can help treat cancer diseases. So I learned about stem cells and wanted to learn about this field to treat cancer, especially after reading the research of professor Yamanaka shinya at Kyoto University on creating induced pluripotent stem cells. pluripotent stem cell - ipsc).

From what my parents shared and Professor Yamanaka's research, I decided to pursue becoming a scientist researching cancer and using stem cells to cure cancer.""

According to Thanh, the US and Japan are the two leading countries in stem cell research in cancer, so studying will be great opportunities to help him go deeper into this field. This is also the reason Thanh wants to go to America and Japan.

The day he set foot in Csusm (USA) to study biotechnology in 2017, he had to go through many challenges. Although he can communicate in English quite well, when listening to a lecture, it is difficult to understand the entire lesson, which is why he failed a few subjects and lost his scholarship.

After graduating, the next joy was winning a biomedical master's scholarship at Tsukuba University in stem cells. Aiming to study for a master's degree, Thanh always tried to achieve a high GPA and graduate on time while studying at university. At the same time, he actively researched stem cell labs in Japan, especially Mr. Ohneda's lab at Tsukuba University, a school that could be considered his long-standing dream.","Một du học sinh ""yêu nước"" ở Nhật cay cú trong vô vọng sau sáp nhập Nhắc đến lý do để Song Thanh quyết định theo đuổi mục tiêu trở thành một nhà khoa học nghiên cứu về ung thư xuất phát từ công việc bác sĩ của bố mẹ. Thanh chia sẻ: “Ba mình là một bác sĩ về gan còn mẹ mình là một bác sĩ nha khoa. Ba mình nói với mình rằng tế bào gốc là lĩnh vực nhiều hứa hẹn trong tương lai có thể giúp chữa trị các bệnh về ung thư. Thế nên mình đã tìm hiểu về tế bào gốc và muốn học về lĩnh vực này để chữa ung thư, nhất là sau khi đọc được những nghiên cứu của Giáo sư (GS) Yamanaka Shinya ở ĐH Kyoto về việc tạo ra những tế bào gốc đa năng (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - iPSC).

Từ những chia sẻ của ba mẹ và những nghiên cứu của GS Yamanaka, mình đã quyết định theo đuổi trở thành một nhà khoa học nghiên cứu về ung thư và sử dụng tế bào gốc để chữa ung thư”.

Theo Thanh tìm hiểu Mỹ và Nhật Bản là hai quốc gia hàng đầu về nghiên cứu tế bào gốc trong ung thư, nên việc học tập sẽ là những cơ hội lớn giúp anh đi sâu về lĩnh vực này. Đây cũng là lý do Thanh mong muốn được đến Mỹ và Nhật.

Ngày đặt chân sang CSUSM (Mỹ) học về Công nghệ sinh học vào năm 2017 Thanh đã phải trải qua nhiều thách thức. Tuy tiếng Anh giao tiếp khá tốt nhưng khi nghe giảng Thanh khó có thể hiểu được toàn bộ bài cũng vì vậy mà anh chàng từng bị trượt vài môn và bị mất học bổng.

Sau khi tốt nghiệp, niềm vui nối tiếp là Thanh giành học bổng Thạc sĩ Y sinh học Đại học Tsukuba về tế bào gốc. Có định hướng học lên Thạc sĩ nên trong thời gian học đại học Thanh luôn cố gắng đạt GPA cao và tốt nghiệp ra trường đúng hạn. Song song với đó, anh chàng chủ động tìm hiểu các lab về tế bào gốc ở Nhật, nhất là lab thầy Ohneda ở Đại học Tsukuba, ngôi trường có thể coi là mơ ước từ lâu của Thanh.

Disclaimer: There are some details in this that I would like to obfuscate to hide my identity. The article contains a mixture of specialized words, English and Vietnamese, please understand. I don't belong to red, yellow, blue, orange or any faction; I just want to stand on a neutral stance to see the most general perspective of all sides.

================================================

Hello everyone in the sub, probably no one in this has gone (or is currently) going to graduate school or studying abroad, so if you feel uninterested, you can stop reading here, thank you.

Introduce yourself briefly: op (m, 21). from the province to study at university in Ho Chi Minh City. major, research orientation. already have ielts (expired). There is no gre or sat yet. Normal family situation, budget &lt;300 million a year.

*why I knew about subs and how I feel about subs*: I knew about subs before the first big wave on Facebook happened. Overall, it's quite confusing, shifting political views. Although there is a lot of extreme information above, there is a lot of new information that also supplements my thinking quite a lot. Too many negative things make me quite stressed when reading it.

*future aspirations*: as I mentioned, I want to pursue my passion, study and work in my dream environment, no matter what the cost is (please don't take it literally). 
The industry I want to work in is not currently developing in Vietnam (there are also some opinions about nckh that have been discussed by people in the sub). I'm willing to work part-time while studying, as well as work for a few years in Vietnam to save money to go abroad. 
What I lack now is direction and guidance from my predecessors (*usually how to settle down, green card, eb5, can international students settle long term, what are the disadvantages and benefits of studying and working abroad,...*). *things that people think that if they knew in their 20s, everyone's lives would be different*.

- what I have been doing:
Just joined a foreign lab (online, no activities yet,...)
Accumulate paper reading skills and math skills such as stats and code
Participate in specialized academic competitions
grind gpa to 3.7
Contacted and connected many phd students and profs via email and social media.
Target has been hired by several teachers and schools in Europe and Japan to work on topics he likes

- Things I want to do after graduation:
1. have one or two scientific articles (currently any rank is fine with Aim, as long as it's not predatory journals)
2. have a close relationship slot with the lab's prof/pi (wet or dry are both ok)
3. (???, this step is difficult and I don't know what to do)
4. Apply for a visa to study abroad. (work part-time to make a living)
5. settle down, possibly return to Vietnam to lead the next generation of young people.

What I'm worried about now is: I will fail the conditions to be able to study and pursue my passion, then be stuck in Vietnam for the rest of my life, get married at 30, work a 9-5 rat race, for some people this is stability, but I want to bring something more impactful, satisfying my ideals, although I don't dare say that it is noble or bigger than other things that people often hope for. it's just each person's delusion i guess.

I really thank you for reading this far. Actually, no words can write all my thoughts about these things, so I'll keep it short for now. If anyone reads this article and just wants to share a little about themselves or exchange, send information and advice but is not comfortable commenting below, please contact via throwaway email at foreignduhoc@gmail.com or comment email below, I will proactively contact you.

Wishing everyone a good working week!.","Sinh viên xin kinh nghiệm đi du học TL;DR (Tại lười, đéo rảnh): Một đứa sinh viên năm 3 crisis về sau này làm gì và xin lời khuyên.

Disclaimer: Có một vài chi tiết trong này xin được obfuscate đi để che giấu danh tính. Bài viết chứa đan xen từ ngữ chuyên ngành, tiếng anh và tiếng việt, mong mn thông cảm. Mình không thuộc đỏ, vàng, xanh, cam hay phe nào cả; mình chỉ muốn đứng trên lập trường trung lập để xem góc nhìn tổng quát nhất của các bên.

==================================

Xin chào mọi người trong sub, hẳn không ai trong này cũng đã (hoặc đang) đi học cao học hoặc đi nghiên cứu nước ngoài, nên nếu cảm thấy không hứng thú có thể dừng đọc tại đây, em/mình xin cảm ơn.

Giới thiệu bản thân ngắn gọn: OP (M, 21). Từ tỉnh lên học ĐH tại TPHCM. Ngành AI, định hướng nghiên cứu. Đã có IELTS (expired). Chưa có GRE hay SAT gì hết. Gia đình hoàn cảnh bình thường, budget &lt;300tr 1 năm.

*Lý do mình biết đến sub và mình cảm thấy thế nào về sub*: Mình biết đến sub trước khi đợt rầm rộ đầu tiên trên facebook diễn ra. Nói chung là cũng khá rối đấy, shifting political views mà. Mặc dù trên đây khá nhiều thông tin cực đoan, nhưng nhiều thông tin mới mẻ cũng bổ sung tư tưởng mình khá nhiều. Nhiều thứ tiêu cực quá cũng khiến mình khá stressed khi đọc đươnc.

*Nguyện vọng sau này*: Như mình đã đề cập, mình mong muốn được theo đuổi đam mê, học tập và làm việc tại môi trường mơ ước, cho dù phải trả bất cứ giá gì đi nữa (please don't take it literally). 
Ngành mà mình muốn làm việc hiện không phát triển ở VN (cũng có vài luồng ý kiến về NCKH đã được mọi người thảo luận trong sub). Mình sẵn sàng đi làm thêm lúc học, cũng như là làm việc một vài năm ở VN để tích tiền sang nước ngoài. 
Thứ mà mình thiếu bây giờ là định hướng, sự hướng dẫn của những người đi trước (*thông thường thì làm thế nào để định cư, thẻ xanh, EB5, du học sinh có khả năng định cư lâu dài không, học tập và làm việc ở nước ngoài có những bất lợi và ích lợi gì, ...*). *Những điều mà mọi người nghĩ rằng nếu tuổi 20 mà biết được thì cuộc đời mọi người có thể khác*.

- Những việc mình đã và đang làm:
Mới tham gia 1 lab nước ngoài (online, chưa có hoạt động gì, ...)
Tích lũy kỹ năng đọc paper và các loại toán như stats, code
Tham gia các cuộc thi học thuật chuyên ngành
Grind gpa lên mức 3.7
Đã liên hệ và connect được nhiều PhD student, prof qua email và social media.
Target được vài giáo và trường bên châu Âu và Nhật Bản, Sing làm về chủ đề mình thích

- Những việc mình mong muốn làm sau khi tốt nghiệp:
1. Có một hai bài báo khoa học (hiện tại aim thì rank nào cũng được, miễn đừng là mấy cái predatory journal)
2. Có một slot quan hệ thân thiết với prof/PI của lab (wet hay dry đều ok)
3. (???, bước này khó không biết cần phải làm gì)
4. Xin visa ra nước ngoài học. (Đi làm parttime để kiếm sống)
5. Định cư, có thể quay về Việt Nam để dẫn dắt thế hệ trẻ tiếp theo.

Điều mà mình lo lắng bây giờ là: mình sẽ fail các điều kiện để có thể học tập và theo đuổi đam mê của mình, sau đó bị kẹt lại ở VN đến cuối đời, 30 cưới vợ, đi làm 9-5 rat race, đối với vài người thì đây là sự ổn định, nhưng mình muốn đem lại một điều gì đó mang tính ảnh hưởng hơn, thỏa mãn lý tưởng của mình, mặc dù mình không dám nói rằng điều đó cao thượng hay to lớn hơn những điều khác mà người ta thường hay mong. It's just each person's delusion I guess.

Mình thực sự cảm ơn mn đã đọc đến đây. Thực sự thì không lời nào có thể viết được hết suy nghĩ của mình về những điều này, nên tạm ngắn gọn như vậy thôi. Nếu có ai đọc được bài viết này mà chỉ muốn chia sẻ một chút về bản thân hoặc trao đổi, nhắn gửi thông tin lời khuyên mà không tiện comment ở dưới, xin hãy liên lạc qua throwaway email tại foreignduhoc@gmail.com hoặc comment email ở dưới, mình sẽ chủ động liên hệ.

Chúc mọi người một tuần làm việc tốt lành!.

1krno6z,1747796595.0,2025-05-21 03:03:15,"Sample essays from scholarship mentors, have you noticed that recently there has been an influx of mentor services for studying abroad on scholarships? The threads are full of people. publicly, clearly state that it is a service. and humble brag said it cleverly and then slowly pulled into the service. 

We all have the same formula that professional media people have prepared. In fact, I have a lot of content. Now whoever comes in, the agency takes it out and uses it. 

Why do they play like this? Simply because this is a very profitable service industry. it is as follows. Now every 10 people go. 

*1 child will have a full scholarship. 
*9 children will have partial scholarships. 

Each of them calculated at least 5-10 million. Just multiply it. Each batch earns 50-100 million which is normal. So now there are so many mentors. 

So are they good? Saying it's not good is wrong. But those scholarships are not what you think. The majority are aid, treaty and poverty alleviation scholarships. Your education level is only 20%. The rest is family background, records and background. Rich countries have poverty alleviation funds. roughly to help poor countries develop. People in Vietnam specialize in fabricating poverty records to hunt for scholarships. Then it exploded because of talent. That's why everything that comes to Vietnam changes. 

At my previous school, there was a kid who received an incentive scholarship. Then he exploded online because of his talent. While everyone who studies knows how to lie. Many students are good but not poor, so they don't apply because even if they apply, they will fail. Their sample text is as follows. 

*gpa is not high, but still hunt for scholarships. 
*After failing many scholarships, ABC somehow won a prestigious scholarship. 
*free mentorship scholarship to study abroad. 
*How I won $500k in scholarships. 

et cetera. In the past, the number of Vietnamese people studying at top schools was small, so people were easily wowed. but as more and more people realized the problem. Those are some of the top schools and companies. They spend money to run ads. Not everyone is a genius, there are always good people and ordinary people. So Vietnam now has a lot of Ivy students because the schools can charge maximum tuition. They are very dangerous to the psychology of Vietnamese people to do business. So worship less. 

Lately, a lot of people hate it so there's a scandal. especially when ivy kids return home after finishing their studies and doing service business. You can get articles about geniuses in the newspaper, most of them are PR companies. But Vietnam is not as good as the explosive press. Yes, Vietnam has surpassed Korea. Open the newspaper and see geniuses with tens of billions in scholarships.","Văn mẫu của đám mentor học bổng Tụi bây có để ý là dạo gần đây có quá trời dịch vụ mentor du học học bổng không. Trên Threads thì đầy đứa. Công khai thì ghi rõ là dịch vụ. Còn humble brag thì nói khéo rồi từ từ kéo vô dịch vụ. 

Tụi này có chung một công thức mà đám làm truyền thông chuyên nghiệp đã soạn sẵn. Thậm chí, tao có nguyên lô content. Giờ đứa nào tới là phía agency lôi ra dùng. 

Tại sao tụi nó là chơi kiểu này? Đơn giản vì đây là ngành dịch vụ siêu lời. Nó như sau. Giờ cứ 10 người đi. 

*1 đứa sẽ có học bổng toàn phần. 
*9 đứa sẽ có học bổng bán phần. 

Mỗi đứa tính bét lắm 5-10 triệu. Cứ vậy nhân lên. Mỗi lô hốt 50-100 triệu mà bình thường. Cho nên bây giờ có quá trời đứa mentor. 

Vậy tụi nó có giỏi không? Nói không giỏi thì sai. Nhưng mấy cái học bổng đó không như tụi mày nghĩ. Đa số là học bổng viện trợ, hiệp ước và xóa đói giảm nghèo. Trình độ học thức của mày chỉ chiếm 20% thôi. Còn lại là gia cảnh, hồ sơ và lý lịch. Các nước giàu có quỹ xóa đói giảm nghèo. Đại khái để giúp các nước nghèo phát triển. Đám ở Việt Nam chuyên bịa hồ sơ nghèo khổ để săn học bổng. Sau đó nổ tung trời là vì tài năng. Cái gì về tới Việt Nam cũng biến tướng là vì vậy. 

Ở RMIT tao trước đây, có đứa kia ăn học bổng khuyến khích. Sau đó lên mạng nổ tung trời là vì tài giỏi. Trong khi ai học cũng biết ba xạo. Nhiều đứa giỏi nhưng không nghèo nên không apply vì có apply cũng rớt. Văn mẫu của tụi nó như sau. 

*GPA không cao, nhưng vẫn săn được học bổng. 
*Sau nhiều lần rớt học bổng, ABC gì đó đã giành được học bổng danh giá. 
*Free mentorship học bổng du học. 
*Mình đã săn được $500k học bổng ra sao. 

Vân vân. Trước đây thì số người Việt Nam học trường top ít nên người ta dễ bị wow. Nhưng khi ngày càng nhiều, người ta nhận ra vấn đề. Đó là mấy trường top là công ty. Họ tung tiền để chạy quảng cáo. Không phải ai cũng là thiên tài mà luôn có người giỏi và người thường. Cho nên Việt Nam bây giờ quá trời đứa học Ivy vì các trường có thể thu học phí ở mức tối đa. Tụi nó rất hiểm tâm lý dân Việt Nam để kinh doanh. Cho nên bớt sùng bái lại. 

Dạo gần đây thì nhiều người ghét quá nên phốt. Nhất là khi đám Ivy học xong về nước rồi kinh doanh dịch vụ. Mấy cái bài về thiên tài trên báo tụi mày được, đa số là công ty chạy PR hết. Chứ Việt Nam đéo có giỏi như báo chí nổ. Đúng thì Việt Nam vượt Hàn Quốc rồi. Mở báo ra toàn thiên tài, học bổng chục tỷ.

1jkwd2s,1743051556.0,2025-03-27 04:59:16,"the way to go abroad.... I greet everyone. I'm a bit confused about the future so I asked everyone for advice.

The thing is that I'm choosing a major but I find it suitable for majors that are not very developed in Vietnam such as geology, hydrology, and environment, so I'm thinking about studying abroad in the future.
Because my family is not very well-off, I have to be self-reliant. I outlined three directions for myself (I study at university in Vietnam):

1 is to apply for a doctorate in the US because the US allows you to study straight from a bachelor's degree to a doctorate.

2 is to find a full scholarship to study a master's degree in Europe

3 is to study for a master's degree in Asia first, such as Korea or Taiwan, then apply for a doctorate in the US, Australia, or Canada.

According to my research, it's like this, there are still many shortcomings, thanks for your feedback:

Direction 1: requires a good profile with research or article experience, high GPA.... I think it's quite difficult but I haven't yet assessed how feasible it is with my abilities. As far as I know, these industries don't have too many training programs, but the number of learners is not as high as other hot industries, so I think the level of competition will be a little less. Currently, I see that the US is cutting funding for research quite a lot or switching to a system where you have to pay money to study for a PhD, I don't know, in a few years.

The second option is to save more time. If I get a scholarship, I will try to find a job to stay after finishing my master's degree in about 2 years, but I'm not sure because the competition is high.

Direction 3 seems most feasible because scholarships in Korea and Taiwan are somewhat easier to find.

In short, I will try to follow direction 1 or 2, if not, then follow direction 3. Do you think such a plan is feasible? Those who have studied for a doctorate can share with me the difficulties in following this path (in submitting a doctorate, researching...) so that I can have a more realistic view. Also, if you are in countries like the US, Australia, Canada or if you know about these fields, please tell me more about the chances of finding a job. I plan to finish my PhD and look for a job outside. I see that Australia is strong in mineral exploitation. I researched and found that the current need for geological engineers is quite high. If you know about the geology industry in Australia, please give me more information. Thank you very much.

A little aside:

Everyone, please give me your opinion on whether I should take the risk to pursue my hobby. If I had to stay in Vietnam, I probably wouldn't choose these fields because I'm not from a rich family so I still prioritize making money. I've also looked into other engineering fields that have more potential, but sadly I don't find them very interesting. If I tried to study, I'd probably still be able to study, but I don't want to just waste my time trying to get a degree, but I also want to study something that I'm ""not bored with"" to explore and research more to get a scholarship to study abroad, for example. I know that even in foreign countries, the salary is not as good as other technology fields. I also think I should be a little more realistic and choose something ""better"" and make more money, but I'm afraid that if I don't like it, I won't be able to strive. I don't know if it's because I'm too worried. What do you think about studying a major that I don't currently enjoy?

I think a lot but I can't express it well, so thank you everyone for taking the trouble to read. I hope everyone will take some time to advise an inexperienced person like me. Thank you very much.","Con đường xuất ngoại.... Em chào mọi người. Em hơi mơ hồ về tương lai nên nhờ mọi người tư vấn giúp.

3 là học thạc sĩ ở châu Á trước như Hàn Quốc, Đài Loan sau đó nộp tiến sĩ ở Mỹ, Úc, Can

Theo em tìm hiểu thì như thế này, còn nhiều thiếu sót nhờ mọi người góp ý giúp:

Hướng 1: đòi hỏi hồ sơ phải đẹp có kinh nghiệm nghiên cứu hoặc bài báo, GPA cao....em nghĩ là khá khó mà cũng chưa đánh giá được mức độ khả thi với khả năng của em như thế nào. Các ngành này theo em được biết thì cũng ko có quá nhiều chương trình đào tạo nhưng số lượng người học cũng ko nhiều như các ngành hot khác nên em nghĩ mức độ cạnh tranh sẽ đỡ hơn một chút. Hiện tại em thấy Mỹ đang cắt funding cho nghiên cứu khá nhiều hoặc chuyển sang hệ phải đóng tiền để học tiến sĩ, em ko biết vài năm nữa sao.

Hướng 2 thì tiết kiệm thời gian hơn, nếu được học bổng thì học xong thạc sĩ khoảng 2 năm em sẽ cố tìm việc ở lại nhưng cũng không dám chắc chắn vì cạnh tranh cao.

Hướng 3 có vẻ khả thi nhất vì học bổng ở Hàn, Đài có phần dễ kiếm hơn.

Tóm lại là em sẽ cố gắng theo được hướng 1 hoặc 2 thì tốt ko thì theo hướng 3. Mọi người thấy kế hoạch như vậy có khả thi ko ạ? Anh chị đã học tiến sĩ có thể chia sẻ giúp em những khó khăn khi theo con đường này ( trong việc nộp tiến sĩ, nghiên cứu...) để em có cái nhìn thực tế hơn. Với lại anh chị đang ở các nước như Mỹ, Úc, Can hoặc có biết về các ngành này cho em hỏi thêm về cơ hội tìm được việc có ổn ko ạ, em định học xong tiến sĩ sẽ tìm việc bên ngoài. Em thấy Úc mạnh về khai thác khoáng sản, em tìm hiểu thì thấy nhu cầu kỹ sư địa chất hiện tại cũng khá nhiều, anh chị có biết về ngành địa chất ở Úc cho em xin thêm thông tin ạ. Em xin cảm ơn rất nhiều.

Tâm sự ngoài lề một chút:

Mọi người cho em xin ý kiến em có nên mạo hiểm để theo đuổi sở thích ko ạ, nếu phải ở VN chắc em sẽ ko chọn các ngành này vì em ko phải con nhà giàu nên vẫn ưu tiên việc kiếm tiền hơn. Em cũng có tìm hiểu các ngành kỹ thuật khác có tiềm năng hơn mà khổ cái là đều ko thấy hứng thú lắm, nếu cố học chắc em vẫn học được nhưng em ko muốn cứ tàn tàn cho có cái bằng mà cũng muốn học gì đó mà em "" ko ngán "" để tìm tòi, nghiên cứu thêm để kiếm học bổng du học chẳng hạn. Em biết là các ngành này dù ở nước ngoài thì lương cũng không bằng các ngành công nghệ kỹ thuật khác, em cũng nghĩ mình nên thực tế một chút chọn ngành gì đó ""ổn"" hơn, kiếm nhiều tiền hơn nhưng em sợ là ko thích thì ko phấn đấu nổi. Em ko biết có phải do em lo lắng thái quá ko, mọi người nghĩ sao về việc học một ngành mà hiện tại mình ko thấy yêu thích ạ ?

Em suy nghĩ nhiều mà diễn đạt cũng ko tốt nên cảm ơn mọi người đã chịu khó đọc. Mong mọi người dành chút thời gian tư vấn cho đứa non nớt như em. Em xin cảm ơn rất nhiều.

Higher education system: throne of wisdom or cage of obedience?

&gt; “A degree doesn't make you smart – it just proves you know how to play by the rules.”




---

i. starting out in the light – university as a glorious illusion

Since ancient times, academia has been the domain of an elite minority – where those who know how to ask questions reign.
University used to be a land of freedom, where students could argue with professors, where knowledge was not bound by political power.

But now?

We live in an age where degrees replace intelligence, and obedience replaces thinking.


---

ii. prisons hidden under the dome of knowledge

1. oriented curriculum - no more room for those who are different

The curriculum is increasingly oriented toward ideology rather than truth.

Who asks: ""Why is Karl Marx revered as a saint?""      
=&gt; will be labeled as reactionary, offensive, even dangerous.

Who else is willing to memorize the concepts of ""anti-oppression"", ""racial justice"", ""redistribution"" like chanting.    
=&gt; will be awarded points, scholarships and academic titles.

2. University: is no longer a place that teaches how to think, but what to think

Today, university lecture halls no longer produce intellectuals, but ideological technicians.
they don't ask questions. they just seek to ""answer correctly according to the answer"".


---

iii. when a degree becomes a chain

1. an ink mark, not a proof

A university degree is like a stamp certifying that you know how to bow your head, how to sit still for 4 years, and how to chew other people's books.

it says nothing about intuition, sense, creativity, and it doesn't prove anything about your understanding of life.

2. Unemployment with a degree – a global phenomenon

People with bachelor's and master's degrees... are still unemployed.     
Why? because they do not create value, only accumulate “gpa points”.


---

iv. Where is the problem?

where the whole system has compromised:

the government poured money into education to ""reduce temporary unemployment"".

Universities turn into diploma printing machines to earn tuition fees.

Students become consumer products, not seekers of truth.



---

v. Resistance – the path of the truly intellectual

dare not believe in the curriculum.

dare to doubt big names.

dare to study outside of school.


&gt; ""Self-study is the only way to possess knowledge. Learning for hire or copying is just working for others.""




---

Conclusion:

&gt; University can be the throne of wisdom, if the person sitting on it knows how to resist.       
Otherwise - it's just a gilded cage, where good birds sing to the right music to get paid.

# the king of the south, the country of the mountains and rivers, Friday, June 13. essay on: higher education system: the throne of wisdom or the cage of the obedient?","Hệ thống giáo dục đại học: Chiếc ngai của trí tuệ hay chiếc lồng của kẻ phục tùng? - Vua Nam ---

Hệ thống giáo dục đại học: Chiếc ngai của trí tuệ hay chiếc lồng của kẻ phục tùng?

&gt; “Một tấm bằng không làm nên trí tuệ – nó chỉ chứng minh bạn biết chơi theo luật.”




---

I. Khởi đầu trong ánh sáng – Đại học như ảo tưởng vinh quang

Từ thời cổ đại, học thuật là lãnh địa của thiểu số tinh hoa – nơi người biết đặt câu hỏi ngự trị.
Đại học từng là vùng đất tự do, nơi sinh viên có thể cãi giáo sư, nơi tri thức không bị trói bởi quyền lực chính trị.

Nhưng hiện nay?

Chúng ta sống trong thời đại mà bằng cấp thay thế trí tuệ, và vâng lời thay thế tư duy.


---

II. Những nhà tù ẩn dưới mái vòm tri thức

1. Giáo trình định hướng – Không còn chỗ cho kẻ dị biệt

Chương trình học ngày càng thiên về ý thức hệ hơn là chân lý.

Kẻ nào hỏi: “Tại sao Karl Marx được tôn sùng như một vị thánh?”      
=&gt; Sẽ bị gán là phản động, phản cảm, thậm chí nguy hiểm.

Còn ai chịu học thuộc các khái niệm ""chống áp bức"", ""công lý chủng tộc"", ""tái phân phối"" như tụng kinh.    
=&gt; Sẽ được thưởng điểm, học bổng và học hàm.

2. Đại học: Không còn là nơi dạy cách nghĩ, mà dạy điều phải nghĩ

Ngày nay, giảng đường đại học không còn sản sinh trí thức, mà sản sinh kỹ thuật viên tư tưởng.
Họ không đặt câu hỏi. Họ chỉ tìm cách “trả lời đúng theo đáp án”.


---

III. Khi tấm bằng trở thành xiềng xích

1. Một dấu mực, không phải một bằng chứng

Tấm bằng đại học giống như con dấu xác nhận bạn biết cúi đầu, biết ngồi yên 4 năm, biết nhai lại sách vở của người khác.

Nó không nói gì về trực giác, cảm quan, sự sáng tạo, càng không chứng minh bạn hiểu gì về cuộc sống.

2. Thất nghiệp có bằng – Một hiện tượng toàn cầu

Người có bằng Cử nhân, Thạc sĩ... vẫn thất nghiệp hàng loạt.     
Tại sao? Vì họ không tạo ra giá trị, chỉ tích lũy “điểm GPA”.


---

IV. Vấn đề nằm ở đâu?

Ở chỗ cả hệ thống đã thỏa hiệp:

Chính phủ đổ tiền vào giáo dục để ""giảm tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tạm thời"".

Trường đại học biến thành cỗ máy in bằng để kiếm học phí.

Sinh viên trở thành sản phẩm tiêu dùng, không phải kẻ tìm kiếm chân lý.



---

V. Phản kháng – Con đường của kẻ thật sự trí thức

Dám không tin vào giáo trình.

Dám nghi ngờ những tên tuổi lớn.

Dám học ngoài trường học.


&gt; “Tự học là cách duy nhất để sở hữu tri thức. Học thuê, học chép chỉ là làm phu cho người khác.”




---

Kết luận:

&gt; Đại học có thể là ngai vàng của trí tuệ, nếu người ngồi trên đó biết phản kháng.       
Còn nếu không – đó chỉ là cái lồng mạ vàng, nơi những con chim ngoan hót theo đúng nhạc để được phát lương.

1aq9rob,1707871574.0,2024-02-14 00:46:14,"Studying medicine in the US, the salaries of doctors, dentists, pharmacists or nurses are very high because the input is difficult and the output is even harder. 

If you want to go to medical, dental or pharmacy school, you should first take a 4-year preparatory course. As a preparatory course, students must study basic subjects such as organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biology and biochemistry. Among them, biochem is the most difficult. 

To enter medical school, the average GPA is at least 3.7-3.8. and must take an entrance exam. The higher the score, the higher the chance of entering. 

To study as a doctor, you must take the medical college admission test (mcat). 

If you want to study pharmacy, take the pharmacy college admission test (pcat). 

When studying to become a dentist, the dental admission test (dat) is required.

If you apply to the school, if you are lucky, you will be called for an interview. And if you're lucky, you'll be accepted into school. 

Study for 4 more years for a total of 8 years of study. 

Graduates who want to practice must take the state board exam and then obtain a state license. If you don't pass the first exam, you won't be able to practice in the US.  

If going to residency, at least 2 more.

Only studying for a doctor's degree but studying for a specialist also takes at least 5 years. 

That's why the medical profession pays high salaries. 

In particular, there are many Indians who work as doctors. Indians are very diligent. If you pay attention, spelling bee means spelling contest, the champions every year are people of Indian origin.","Học ngành y bên Mỹ Ở bên Mỹ lương bác sĩ, nha sĩ, dược sĩ hay y tá rất cao là do đầu vào đã khó đầu ra còn khó hơn. 

Muốn vào trường y, nha hay dược đầu tiên là học dự bị 4 năm. Dự bị là phải học những bắt buộc như hóa hữu cơ (organic chemistry), his với cơ (inorganic chemistry), sinh học và biochem. Trong đó biochem là khó nhất. 

Để vào trường y điểm trung bình GPA ít nhất là 3.7-3.8. Và phải thi một bài kiểm tra đầu vào. Điểm càng cao cơ hội vào càng cao. 

Học bác sĩ phải thi cái Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). 

Học dược sĩ thì thi cái Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). 

Học nha sĩ thì thì cái Dental Admission Test (DAT)

Nộp hồ sơ vào trường nếu may mắn sẽ được gọi đi phỏng vấn. Và nếu may mắn nữa sẽ được nhận vào trường học. 

Học thêm 4 năm nữa tổng cộng là 8 năm học. 

Ra trường muốn hành nghề phải thi cái state board exam rồi sau đó thì thêm cái bằng hành nghề của tiểu bang. Ko đậu cái kì thi đầu tiên thì sẽ ko được hành nghề ở Mỹ.  

Nếu đi residency thì ít nhất là 2 nữa.

Riêng học bác sĩ mà học specialist tức chuyên ngành nữa là ít nhất 5 năm. 

Cho nên ngành y trả lương cao là vậy. 

Đặc biệt bên Mỹ dân Ấn làm bác sĩ rất nhiều. Tụi ấn độ nó rất siêng. Nếu để ý thì spelling bee tức cuộc thi đánh vần thì quán quân năm nào cũng là tụi gốc Ấn.","study medicine u , salary doctor , dentist , pharmacist nurse very high because input difficult output even hard . if you want go medical , dental pharmacy school , you should first take a 4 - year preparatory course . a a preparatory course , student must study basic subject such a organic chemistry , inorganic chemistry , biology biochemistry . among them , biochem most difficult . enter medical school , average gpa least 3 . 7 - 3 . 8 . must take an entrance exam . high score , high chance enter . study a a doctor , you must take medical college admission test ( mcat ). if you want study pharmacy , take pharmacy college admission test ( pcat ). when study become a dentist , dental admission test ( dat ) require . if you apply school , if you lucky , you will call an interview . if you're lucky , you'll accept into school . study 4 more year a total 8 year study . graduate who want practice must take state board exam then obtain a state license . if you don't pass first exam , you won't able practice u . if go residency , least 2 more . only study a doctor's degree study a specialist also take least 5 year . that's why medical profession pay high salary . particular , there many indian who work a doctor . indian very diligent . if you pay attention , spell bee mean spell contest , champion every year people indian origin .",Normal
1c19pia,1712823089.0,2024-04-11 08:11:29,"Confiding about my teenage years about studying. When I was in high school, I dreamed of going to a dirty country to die and enjoy studying and all that, but back then I was dreaming in vain, dreaming without a plan, daydreaming all day long. I remember during the Covid period studying online, I sat looking at bachelor's programs in the West while I studied stupidly, my family was just okay so I couldn't go to countries like the UK, the Netherlands, the US or something like that. At night, imagining the blissful life of heaven is mind-boggling. When I go to school in the morning, I'm faced with reality with my stupidity. Fortunately, I'm just a normal idiot. Later I realized that I should be less delusional and focus more on reality. Luckily, I was still able to get a slot at the top university in Vietnam.



One surprising thing is that I see a lot of people in this university who are just like me in high school. It's been 3 or 4 years more than when they were in high school, but their minds are still in the clouds. Every morning when I go to school I sit and laugh, I don't want to actively study, I sit dead still and I never ask questions in class. Going out in the afternoons, drinking coffee, taking photos, posting prints, studying, studying and stuff, it's very chill. At night, I surf Facebook to look for life in the West and share some posts about architectural knowledge, cuisine or something, but I think I read it just to know, not to do anything. When it's time to take the exam or give a presentation, you'll be hit in the face with the reality of your lack of skills, knowledge, and ignorance accumulated over a long time, then spend money to study again.

I don't consider myself good, but I have enough ability to judge someone as stupid (more than me). Sometimes I just wish they wouldn't be stupid anymore, so I could have a competitive environment, but being surrounded by stupid people, it's really frustrating. But I'm also happy because they seem to kick their ass off the track with me.



Now I see myself living realistically, at least more than I did before. Well, it's my own fault that I didn't get a bachelor's degree, so now I'm trying to get a master's degree. Try to make your CV look nicer, have a higher GPA (already done), accumulate some soft skills, but don't go online and masturbate with useless things. No one can bathe in the same river twice.



I plan to get a master's degree in journalism, because I am (somewhat) passionate about writing and reading. Although it's not my main passion, because my dream is to be a musician and singer lol. But the job usually won't match your passion, so I don't think it's that important. I can't perform in an orchestra or sing in front of an audience, so I'm happy to play music for my family and children.



Naturally, I also feel lucky because I went through the experience of spiritual exploration in high school, so now I have lessons to learn.","Tâm sự tuổi lồn về chuyện học hành.

I don't know if there are any seniors here who have gone before, please give me more experience and share. Money is not a problem for my family. I went there with the only goal of finishing my degree, then trying to settle there, that was also my family's wish.

Không biết trong đây có tiền bối nào đi trước, cho em xin thêm kinh nghiệm, chia sẻ. Tiền bạc với nhà em ko thành vấn đề.

Because my economic conditions are not very well-off and it is difficult to get a high-level hb to study abroad, I plan to study data science at vnu-hus. During that time, I will diligently start learning Japanese and improve my qualifications with the goal of graduating and getting a good job in Japan and saving money to study for a master's degree in an English-speaking country later. So I want to ask you if this direction is really feasible or not, because in my opinion, getting a visa in English-speaking countries is not easy, and because I have a long-time family member in Japan, they can also help me with visa-related procedures there.

1nk73ka,1758199003.0,2025-09-18 12:36:43,"[confession] Last month I was a salaryman, plowing through the company like a buffalo every day. Unfortunately, my boss is not human, he must be a devil in human form! All day he stood behind, panting as if he had just run a marathon, his eyes glaring, his mouth hissing: ""Hurry up, deadline chasing is close to your ass!"" Deadlines are always pressing every day, I thought he wanted me to marry the deadline!



The other day, I worked on a report until 2 a.m., my eyes were burning, my hands were shaking like parkinson's. However, in the morning, the boss looked at the report and said in a cold voice: ""Throw this away, do it again!"" Damn it, I want to scream: ""Throw it away, throw me away too, so I can go home and raise fish!"" However, the rent, food, and milk tea for my crush haven't been paid yet, so I have to sadly continue plowing.



I thought I would endure it and get used to it, but yesterday my boss played the last shot. It forced the whole team to stay overtime until 10pm, without giving them anything to eat or drink, the reason being ""the customer needed it urgently"". Hurry up monkey! I checked the email calendar, that customer is chilling like he's on vacation, there's no urgent need! I was angry, very angry, but I only dared to curse in my heart. The peak was when the shift ended, the boss even said: ""Remember to work early tomorrow, anyone who is late will have his salary deducted!"" Oh my god, I want to take a chair and smash it straight into that arrogant face!



I was so angry, I decided to solve my bad luck. That night, I wandered through the ""red light"" neighborhood near my house, planning to find a concubine to confide in to ease my feelings. Pick a pretty girl, standing on the corner, short skirt, red lips, eyes glaring like ""hey bro, come here and play"". I walked closer, but before I could say anything... peep peep! A motorbike came out of nowhere, headlights flashing, it turned out to be civil defense! The vigilante guy shouted: ""Stop, check!"" I was scared, flustered, stammering: ""Yes, yes, I'm just passing by, it's nothing!"" The concubine next to me was calm, took out her phone and took a selfie with a cup, probably posting a story to show off that the civil defense asked about her.



So I was dragged back to the ward and sat writing a review until midnight. The guards also asked: ""Why did you come out here at night?"" I want to tell all about the company drama and how oppressive my boss is, but I'm afraid of telling it and I'll say: ""This guy is stressed at work so he's cheating?"" So, I had to confess: ""Yes, I went for a walk to cool off."" What's cool when my sweat is flowing like a shower!



Finally, when I returned home at 3 am, I sat blankly looking at the ceiling, wondering: ""Where did I go wrong with my life filled with drama like this?"" The boss is oppressive, and when I go to solve bad luck, I get caught by the vigilantes. I must have been a drama boss in my past life or something! Okay, I'll start plowing again tomorrow. If I stop, I won't be able to get money to pay my crush's debt. To be honest, I just want to scream, fuck my life, I'm going to Cambodia to be your sister

Mà khổ cái, sếp tui không phải người, chắc là quỷ đội lốt người! Cả ngày nó đứng sau lưng, thở hổn hển như mới chạy marathon, mắt lườm lườm, miệng thì rít: ""Làm nhanh lên, deadline dí sát đít rồi!"" Deadline gì mà ngày nào cũng dí, tui tưởng nó muốn tui cưới luôn cái deadline cho rồi!



Hôm nọ, tui làm báo cáo đến 2 giờ sáng, mắt cay xè, tay run như Parkinson. Vậy mà sáng ra, sếp nhìn qua cái báo cáo, phán một câu xanh rờn: ""Cái này vứt, làm lại!"" Mẹ kiếp, tui muốn hét lên: ""Vứt thì vứt luôn tui đi, để tui về quê nuôi cá!"" Nhưng mà, tiền nhà, tiền ăn, tiền trà sữa cho crush còn chưa trả, nên đành ngậm ngùi cày tiếp.



Cứ tưởng chịu đựng riết rồi quen, ai ngờ hôm qua sếp chơi cú chót. Nó bắt cả team ở lại tăng ca tới 10 giờ tối, không cho ăn uống gì, lý do là ""khách hàng cần gấp"". Gấp cái con khỉ! Tui tra lịch mail, khách hàng đó chill như đi nghỉ mát, có cần gấp đâu! Tui tức, tức lắm, mà chỉ dám chửi thầm trong bụng. Đỉnh điểm là lúc tan ca, sếp còn phán: ""Mai nhớ làm sớm, thằng nào đi trễ trừ lương!"" Trời ơi, tui muốn cầm ghế phang thẳng vào cái bản mặt vênh váo đó!



Tức quá, tui quyết định phải giải xui. Đêm đó, lượn qua khu phố ""đèn đỏ"" gần nhà, tính tìm em phò nào đó tâm sự cho nhẹ lòng. Chọn đại một em nhìn cũng ngon nghẻ, đang đứng góc đường, váy ngắn, môi đỏ, mắt lườm lườm kiểu ""anh ơi, lại đây chơi"". Tui mon men tới, chưa kịp mở lời thì... Píp píp! Một chiếc xe máy từ đâu lao tới, đèn pha chói lòa, hóa ra là dân phòng! Thằng cha dân phòng quát: ""Đứng im, kiểm tra!"" Tui hoảng, luống cuống, lắp bắp: ""Dạ, dạ, tui đi ngang thôi, không có gì đâu anh!"" Em phò bên cạnh thì tỉnh bơ, rút điện thoại selfie cái tách, chắc up story khoe bị dân phòng hỏi thăm.



Thế là tui bị lôi về phường, ngồi viết bản kiểm điểm đến nửa đêm. Dân phòng còn hỏi: ""Làm gì mà đêm hôm mò ra đây?"" Tui muốn kể hết drama công ty, sếp áp bức thế nào, nhưng sợ kể ra nó bảo: ""Thằng này stress công việc nên đi đá phò à?"" Nên thôi, đành khai: ""Dạ, tui đi dạo cho mát."" Mát cái gì nổi khi mồ hôi tui chảy như tắm!



Cuối cùng, thả về nhà lúc 3 giờ sáng, tui ngồi thẫn thờ nhìn trần nhà, tự hỏi: ""Mình sống sai ở đâu mà đời toàn drama thế này?"" Sếp thì áp bức, đi giải xui thì bị dân phòng tóm, chắc kiếp trước tui là trùm drama hay sao! Thôi, mai lại cày, chứ nghỉ thì lấy đâu tiền trả nợ crush. Mà nói thật, tui chỉ muốn hét lên đm đời tao sang campuchia làm em anh Đạt đây

10p9wzf,1675103101.0,2023-01-30 18:25:01,"What to do when you feel empty and don't want to do anything? The story is that I work as a developer. I'm currently so bored with my current job. The more I work, the more I feel hopeless and empty. But when I quit, I don't know what else to do to earn my current income.

What I want is a free life of sitting on my laptop, surfing the web, listening to music, watching movies, going online all day without being bothered by anyone (not having to bury my face in code), every morning I go to a cafe to sit and watch people, on the weekends I go around somewhere, and then every month I go on a road trip somewhere far away to lighten my head.

My current job makes me so stressed that I no longer enjoy anything.

I also want to get married and have children like everyone else, but my finances are not stable. Thinking about the situation in the morning and being pressed by the boss for deadlines, and in the afternoon, my wife nagging me about housework and money matters, makes me scared.

In a time when people are competing with each other on social networks, getting married is even more distant for me. I don't know how to find a wife who is not addicted to social networks, and is not angry with people like other people. Looking at girls these days, they post everything on social media to show off, but for a guy with a lowkey lifestyle like me, there probably isn't any girl who wants it.

But even if you find a child who is not materialistic, raising a child will require money in the future. Without money in this era, your child will not have a chance to compete with the world.

My dream is to find a daughter who is not materialistic, introverted, and does not want to have children with me and spend the rest of my life chilling with her, but perhaps it is hopeless in this day and age.

My life is increasingly sinking into hopelessness!","Làm gì khi cảm thấy trống rỗng, không muốn làm gì hết? Chuyện là tao làm dev, hiện tại quá chán công việc hiện tại, càng đi làm càng cảm thấy cuộc sống bế tắc, trống rỗng nhưng nghỉ thì tao cũng không biết làm nghề gì khác để có thu nhập như hiện tại.

Thứ tao muốn là cuộc sống tự do tự tại ngồi ôm lap lướt web, nghe nhạc, xem phim, lên mạng xàm lông cả ngày không bị ai làm phiền (chứ không phải cắm mặt vào code), mỗi sáng ra quán cafe ngồi nhìn thiên hạ, cuối tuần thì đi vòng vòng đâu đó rồi tháng thì đi phượt đâu đó xa xa cho nhẹ đầu.

Công việc hiện tại làm tao stress quá chẳng còn hứng thú tận hưởng gì cả.

Tao cũng thèm lấy vợ, sinh con như người ta lắm nhưng kinh tế chưa vững, nghĩ đến cảnh sáng thì bị sếp dí deadline, chiều về vợ cằn nhằn việc nhà, chuyện tiền nông là tao lại sợ.

Thời buổi mxh con người ganh nhau từng tí một thì chuyện lấy vợ với tao lại càng xa vời, tao cũng không biết cách nào để tìm ra đc 1 con vợ không ghiền mxh, không sân si với thiên hạ như người ta. Nhìn bọn con gái thời nay cái gì cũng đăng lên mxh khoe thì với thằng có lối sống lowkey như tao thì chắc cũng ko có con nào thèm.

Mà kể cả có tìm ra 1 đứa không mê vật chất thì sau này nuôi con cũng cần tiền, không có tiền ở cái thời đại này thì con mình cũng không có cửa cạnh tranh với thiên hạ.

Ước mơ của tao là tìm ra được 1 đứa con gái không ham mê vật chất, hướng nội, không muốn sinh con cùng tao chill cả đời nhưng có lẽ là vô vọng trong thời đại bây giờ.

Cuộc sống của tao ngày càng chìm trong bế tắc!","what do when you feel empty don't want do anything ? story i work a a developer . i'm currently bored my current job . more i work , more i feel hopeless empty . when i quit , i don't know what else do earn my current income . what i want a free life sit my laptop , surf web , listen music , watch movie , go online all day without bother anyone ( not have bury my face code ), every morning i go a cafe sit watch people , weekend i go around somewhere , then every month i go a road trip somewhere far away lighten my head . my current job make me stress i no longer enjoy anything . i also want get married have child like everyone else , my finance not stable . think about situation morning press bos deadline , afternoon , my wife nag me about housework money matter , make me scared . a time when people compete each other social network , get marry even more distant me . i don't know how find a wife who not addict social network , not angry people like other people . look girl these day , they post everything social medium show off , a guy a lowkey lifestyle like me , there probably isn't any girl who want . even if you find a child who not materialistic , raise a child will require money future . without money era , your child will not have a chance compete world . my dream find a daughter who not materialistic , introvert , do not want have child me spend rest my life chill her , perhaps hopeless day age . my life increasingly sink into hopelessness !",Depression

- In the school environment, there are no girls, deadline chasing sml, so the whole life of the school is full of joblessness and loneliness. People still have parents who give them money to study AV to flirt with girls, but poor people like me can only study on their own, but we don't have the money to study AV :(

- The companies are only in Singapore/Hanoi, so if you want to go back to your hometown to work, there's almost no hope.

- The career is extremely short, probably equal to that of a worker. If you're a little older, if you don't get a job as a boss or manager, you'll probably just return home to work as a buffalo.

- The job is also full of contact with computers =&gt; easily leads to limited communication ability and difficulty in expanding social relationships =&gt; easy to be lonely

- High income but difficult to get rich, difficult to buy a house, difficult to have many breakthroughs in career

- In the countryside, we don't have the conditions to learn AV early (in my generation), so we lose out in many things, especially in this industry. But this loss will lead to other losses, gradually losing many opportunities compared to those who learned AV from childhood.



I advise people from small provinces + poor people like me to avoid a small career, it's not as good as you think unless you are truly outstanding and can compete with those who have houses in SG/Han, otherwise you will be a lousy person.

Working as a worker in the countryside still has the hope of getting married and having a wife and children, even though it's a bit poor, but if you go to the city and do it, you'll be single forever.

188cra7,1701439758.0,2023-12-01 14:09:18,"What does a child living in a single-parent family experience? (part 1: sharing my heart) I was born in 2003, I want to talk about my journey over the past 20 years so that people can understand what I've been through and my aspirations for the future. Everyone, just think of me as reading someone's diary.  


\-1 year old: parents divorced, mother took her to live with her maternal family including grandmother, a married step-aunt and 2 little boys.  


\-About my parents: my father is a waste in my eyes, he only provides support twice a year, calls a few times a year, never comes to visit like other people's fathers. When I passed university, he stopped providing support, gifts and cakes took a long time to come. My mother is 10 points, both beautiful, talented and super easy-going. From childhood to adulthood, I was rarely scolded by my mother, never spanking or being overly imposing, different from other people. What I see in other people's mothers. She often volunteers, is a vegetarian, participates in short-term retreats and loves Buddhism. She hopes to live in a temple or go back to her hometown to buy a small house and live peacefully alone when she gets old, without having to worry about her children.  


\-kindergarten: my mother worked for a garment company. I was assigned to my grandmother's family or her friends to take care of me on my days off. Luckily, I was loved by both sides, given toys, enough food, cakes, fruits, cartoons, etc. But I learned to feel sorry for myself from an early age. At school, my friends were picked up by their parents, but I was only allowed to do that by my grandmother's family or the homeroom teacher (who was also my mother's friend).  


\-level 1: mother gradually advances thanks to experience + has a red hcmut certificate from before, life is less miserable. I always strived to be a student throughout elementary school. But I was often ridiculed and disparaged by my friends in the neighborhood and a few mean neighbors because I was poor and my parents were divorced. In return, I had the opportunity to hang out with 2 female friends from the same family background in the neighborhood, who have been friends for more than 10 years now.  


\-9 years old: because of ''my anger'', I slapped a girl from a group of bullies in the neighborhood and her nose bled because she insulted my mother. At that time, I was so scared that I ran back to cry with my grandmother. Her parents came over to talk to my grandmother's family. Thanks to the support of my two close friends and their families, the neighbor's aunt and uncle witnessed the ferocity of my maternal family, I was spared, and the other girl's parents did not make things difficult for me anymore. My two close friends and I have since escaped being bullied by that group.  


\-11 years old: the year that changed the rest of my life later. God loved my mother and let her win a special lottery with 5 tickets to buy support. After finishing elementary school, mother and daughter said goodbye to their grandmother's house, moved to Saigon to build a new life with the money that fell from the sky.  


\-secondary school: my mother bought an old apartment in district 9, registered me in a secondary school in the district. The remaining amount was combined with an additional loan to open a company + invest in land. I still tried to study well, helping my mother with housework to share the burden to help her. I was so used to my mother coming home early and coming home late, sometimes I slept at the company. I had to ride my bike to school by myself, and in addition to studying at school, I also had to take extra classes and take piano lessons.  


\-14 years old: I got rid of the after effects of being bullied in the past by bullying the girl at my desk. Not only did she not study well, but she was also dark and shy. She was always isolated and was bullied by some classmates. I always pinched her hand every time she couldn't solve a problem on the board. Every time I showed her a lesson, she deliberately gave me a difficult problem to solve. If she couldn't solve it, I would criticize her and let her parents take care of her. How hard it is to study hard to create pressure. At test time, I will leave you alone by sitting with my partner and letting you sit alone. There are a few times I bad-mouthed your friend to my best friend in the same class as the homeroom teacher.  


\-16 years old: my mother's business increased and she got lucky, I got into a public high school in another district, and was constantly pressured by luck. Mother and I had to pack up and live in a 200m2 house, starting a series of days of good food, driving a car, having a few real estate to save, traveling everywhere from here. But my mother changed 180 degrees, she often went online to earn 419 odds a couple of times a week, even to Even my business partner was not spared. I ignored myself, became a vegetarian, followed Buddhism, and regularly went to the temple. I started to lose a lot of affection for my mother from here. My ability to study also went down, and throughout high school, no matter how hard I tried, I could only get good grades, so miserable, everyone.  


\-17 years old: won the 1st runner-up prize in the school's elegance contest. I participated because I was bullied by the whole class, and have had a bit of aura in school since then. A few months later, I quietly went to a psychologist and was diagnosed with moderate-level depression, a result of my perfectionist personality along with past trauma. I started a series of days of being friends with alcohol and cigarettes for 4 years now but still I try to hide from everyone. I still disguise myself as an elegant, sociable, self-sufficient person","Một đứa trẻ sống trong gia đình đơn thân trải qua những gì ? (Phần 1: Trải lòng)  Mình sn 2003 ,mình muốn tâm sự về hành trình 20 năm qua của mình để người hiểu những gì mình trải qua và những nguyện vọng của mình trong tương lai.Mọi người cứ coi như mình đang đọc nhật ký của ai đó đi.  


\-1 tuổi : Bố mẹ ly hôn,được mẹ ẵm về sống với nhà ngoại gồm bà ngoại,một dì kế đã có gia đình và 2 cậu nhỏ.  


\-Về bố mẹ mình : Bố là thứ bỏ đi trong mắt mình , ông ấy chỉ cấp dưỡng 1 năm 2 lần ,gọi điện ít lần mỗi năm,chưa bao giờ đến thăm nom giống bố nhà người ta.Năm mình đậu Đại học thì ngưng chu cấp,quà bánh thì lâu lắm mới có.Mẹ mình thì 10 điểm ,vừa đẹp vừa giỏi và siêu dễ tính.Từ nhỏ đến lớn mình ít bị mẹ mắng lắm,đòn roi hay áp đặt thái quá thì chưa bao giờ,khác với những gì mình thấy ở mẹ nhà người ta.Mẹ thường xuyên đi thiện nguyện,ăn chay,tham gia các khóa tu ngắn hạn và yêu đạo Phật.Có nguyện vọng sẽ sống trong chùa hoặc về quê mua nhà nhỏ sống yên ổn một mình khi về già, không cần con cái lo.  


\-Mẫu giáo: Mẹ làm cho công ty may,mình được giao cho nhà ngoại hoặc bạn bè mẹ chăm vào ngày nghỉ .May mắn là ở bên nào cũng được yêu thương,được cho đồ chơi,ăn uống đầy đủ, cho bánh trái ,đĩa hoạt hình các thứ.Nhưng mình biết tủi thân từ sớm,ở trường bạn bè được bố mẹ đưa rước thì mình chỉ được nhà ngoại hoặc cô chủ nhiệm(cũng là bạn của mẹ) làm điều đó.  


\-Cấp 1 : Mẹ dần thăng tiến nhờ kinh nghiệm+có bằng đỏ HCMUT từ trước,cuộc sống đỡ khổ hơn. Mình luôn phấn đấu là hsg suốt cấp 1. Nhưng mình hay bị mấy bạn trong xóm cùng số ít cô chú hàng xóm xấu tính chế giễu,miệt thị vì đã nghèo mà bố mẹ còn ly hôn. Bù lại, mình có duyên chơi được với 2 bạn nữ cùng gia cảnh trong xóm, thân đến nay hơn 10 năm rồi.  


\-9 tuổi : Vì ''tức nước vỡ bờ'' , mình tát một bạn nữ của nhóm bắt nạt trong xóm chảy máu mũi vì bạn ấy xúc phạm tới mẹ mình .Lúc ấy sợ quá mà chạy về khóc với ngoại, bố mẹ bạn ấy qua nói chuyện với nhà ngoại.Nhờ sự bênh vực của 2 bạn thân cùng gia đình 2 bạn, cô chú hàng xóm chứng kiến cùng với sự hung dữ của nhà ngoại mà mình được tha, bố mẹ bạn kia không làm khó dễ gì nữa. Mình với 2 bạn thân từ đó thoát khỏi việc bị bắt nạt từ đám kia luôn.  


\-11 tuổi : Cái năm đã thay đổi phần đời còn lại của mình sau này.Ông trời thương mẹ mà cho mẹ TRÚNG SỐ đặc biệt tận 5 tờ mua ủng hộ.Học xong cấp 1,hai mẹ con tạm biệt nhà ngoại , dọn lên Sài Gòn gây dựng cuộc sống mới với số tiền trên trời rớt xuống kia.  


\-Cấp 2 : Mẹ mua chung cư cũ bên Q9 ,đăng ký cho mình vào một một trường cấp 2 trong quận.Còn nhiêu thì kết hợp với vay thêm để mở công ty+đầu tư đất.Mình vẫn cố gắng học thật giỏi,phụ mẹ việc nhà để san sẻ bớt gánh nặng giúp mẹ.Quá quen với việc mẹ đi sớm về khuya,đôi lần ngủ lại ở công ty luôn.Mình phải tự đạp xe đi học,ngoài học trên trường còn phải học thêm,học piano.  


\-14 tuổi :Mình thanh lọc những di chứng do bị bắt nạt trong quá khứ bằng cách bắt nạt bạn nữ cùng bàn , bạn ấy không những học kém mà còn đen đúa,nhút nhát.Bạn ấy luôn bị cô lập,từng bị một số bạn trong lớp bắt nạt.Mình luôn cấu véo tay bạn mỗi khi bạn ấy không giải được bài trên bảng, lần nào chỉ bài đều cố tình lấy bài khó cho bạn giải , không giải được thì sẽ chỉ trích ,đem việc bố mẹ bạn nuôi bạn ăn học cực khổ ra sao để gây áp lực.Vào giờ kiểm tra thì mình sẽ bỏ mặc bạn bằng cách chuyển qua ngồi với đứa chơi chung ,cho bạn ngồi một mình.Có ít lần nói xấu bạn ấy cho bạn thân cùng lớp với cô chủ nhiệm.  


\-16 tuổi :Mẹ làm ăn lên kèm theo trúng đất ,mình đậu vào một trường cấp 3 công lập ở quận khác , liên tục bị may mắn chèn ép.Hai mẹ con phải cuốn gói xuống đất ở căn nhà 200m2,bắt đầu chuỗi ngày tháng ăn ngon, đi ô tô, có vài bđs để dành, du lịch khắp nơi từ đây.Nhưng mẹ thay đổi 180 độ,bà ấy hay lên mạng kiếm kèo 419 mỗi tuần đôi lần, thậm chí đến cả đối tác làm ăn cũng không tha.Mặc kệ bản thân ăn chay,theo Phật,thường xuyên đi chùa.Mình bắt đầu mất đi nhiều tình cảm với mẹ từ đây.Sức học cũng đi xuống ,suốt cấp 3 dù cố mấy cũng chỉ được loại Khá ,khổ sở lắm mọi người ạ.  


\-17 tuổi : Đạt giải Á khôi 1 trong cuộc thi thanh lịch trường tổ chức,mình tham gia do bị cả lớp dí,có chút ít hào quang trong trường từ đó.Mấy tháng sau, mình âm thầm đi khám tâm lý,được chuẩn đoán là bị t,r,ầ,m c,ả,m+ rlla cấp độ Vừa,thành quả từ tính cách cầu toàn cùng với tổn thương trong quá khứ làm nên.Bắt đầu chuỗi ngày làm bạn với rượu bia,thuốc lá đến nay được 4 năm nhưng vẫn cố giấu tất cả mọi người.Mình vẫn ngụy trang thành một đứa thanh lịch,hòa đồng,tự tin với bạn bè, diễn tròn vai đứa con gương mẫu trước mặt mẹ và người lớn.Hằng ngày phải đeo mặt nạ để sống.  


\-18 tuổi : Có duyên với đạo Công giáo, mình thích nó rất nhiều dù là Phật tử, thường xuyên đi lễ từ đây .Nhưng bên cạnh đó cũng biết đến mấy club và quán nhậu, mình đi một mình 1 lần/tuần khi stress.Đậu được trường đại học kèm theo ngành mình thích với sự ủng hộ của mẹ.Cùng 2 cô bạn thân đi chuyến du lịch đầu tiên của 3 đứa với số tiền nuôi ống heo chung được mấy năm ,ăn mừng cả đám đều đậu Đại học.Đi gần 1 tháng tính nốt mấy ngày bị cách ly luôn.  


\-19 tuổi -&gt; Nay : Mẹ mua căn hộ bên Q7 với ô tô để sang tên cho mình ,chu cấp mỗi tháng để sống riêng 4 năm đại học.Mình vẫn đi làm thêm từ chạy bàn, nhân viên siêu thị cho đến mẫu ảnh.Nếu khuya không có deadline , mất ngủ thì rượu bia,thuốc lá hoặc đi lễ online.Cuối tuần thường đi nhà thờ rồi đi quẩy,lâu lâu sẽ đi thiện nguyện hoặc tụ tập bạn bè đi chơi xa,đi khám tâm lý 2 lần/tháng và đang trong quá trình lấy bằng B1.  


Giờ mình chỉ muốn học xong đại học, đi du học thạc sĩ theo ý muốn của mẹ, xong về nước làm việc cho mẹ. Mình kiên định với việc không yêu đương, lập gia đình vì tỷ lệ ly hôn bây giờ bị lạm phát.Chưa kể bây giờ xuất hiện nhiều vấn nạn hôn nhân quá( ngoại tình,blgđ ,toan tính tài sản...).Mình cũng mặc cảm sâu sắc về lai lịch của mình (bố mẹ ly hôn + mẹ lăng nhăng).Chắc chắn sau này quen ai đều sẽ bị đối phương kèm theo nhà trai khinh thường,kì thị,mối quan hệ sẽ không đi đến đâu hết.Những lí do ấy giúp mình có nghị lực sống độc thân cả đời để sống vì bản thân hơn,bên cạnh chăm lo cho mẹ đến khi mẹ sang tên công ty cùng cả gia tài qua cho mình.

15enqaq,1690827595.0,2023-07-31 18:19:55,"Future orientation I am currently a first year IT student, top school in sg. Compared to my classmates, I'm in the middle, neither good nor bad. Currently, I still play more than study. Only when taking exams do I bury myself in reviewing the knowledge thoroughly, so even though I did not fail the exam, I still fully understood the assignment, but I am still under pressure compared to good friends who have clear directions, working on projects all day, learning new knowledge. 

Personally, I think this field is suitable for me, but I don't feel very passionate about it. It's like I'm studying out of obligation. If I have a deadline, I do it but don't do any further research. My average in 2 semesters is over 8. My school only assigns majors at the end of the 2nd year. I think I will choose data science simply for 2 reasons: I can study math and I want to do something economics-oriented in the future (before I was confused about economics and it, I found myself quite ok in absorbing knowledge of economics, having studied general economics and econometrics). 

My goal is to go abroad, study or do anything. My family is not rich or connected, my family is all government in the province, they can only raise me to study in Vietnam. English is also not invested in learning at the center because there are no conditions. My current level is only about 5.0 - 5.5 Ielts.

I don't know anyone with previous experience, so I don't know who to ask, and I'm not the type of person who is too aggressive when it comes to relationships. Seeing that the sub has so many good seniors, I would like to ask for useful advice so that I can have some direction and go abroad before getting married. Thank you.","Định hướng tương lai Em hiện năm nhất IT, trường top ở sg. So với các bạn cũng khóa em thuộc dạng ở giữa không giỏi không dở.

Bản thân em thấy ngành này hợp với mình, nhưng em lại chưa thấy đam mê với nó lắm, giống như em đang học vì nghĩa vụ vậy ạ, có deadline thì em làm chứ cũng ko nghiên cứu thêm gì. Trung bình 2 kì của em trên 8. Trường em cuối năm 2 mới phân chuyên ngành, em có suy nghĩ sẽ chọn khoa học dữ liệu đơn giản vì 2 lí do: em học toán cũng được và em muốn sau này làm gì đó thiên về kinh tế (trước em phân vân kinh tế và IT, em thấy mình cũng khá ok trong việc tiếp thu kiến thức kte, có học qua kinh tế đại cương, kinh tế lượng). 

Mục tiêu của em là được ra nước ngoài, học hay làm gì cũng được. Gia đình em không giàu không quan hệ, gia đình toàn nhà nước ở tỉnh, chỉ nuôi em học ở Việt Nam thì được. Tiếng anh cũng không được đầu tư học trung tâm vì ko có điều kiện. Trình độ em hiện tại chỉ khoảng 5.0 - 5.5 ielts.

Em không quen thân ai có kinh nghiệm đi trước nên không biết hỏi ai, cũng không phải kiểu người quá năng nổ đi quan hệ này nọ. Thấy sub có nhiều tiền bối giỏi quá em xin thỉnh cầu những lời khuyên bổ ích để có một cái định hướng gì đó và được đi nước ngoài trước khi lấy vợ ạ.

My family is not well off, we are farmers. When I finished 12th grade, I had to go to the city to earn money to send back to my family. I also wished to go to university like everyone else.

Then after the Covid period, I saved up money to go back to school. I tried to work and study at the same time. My family still couldn't help me much, but always called or complained about all kinds of family matters.

After I graduated, I sent messages to my family every month, but those complaining calls never stopped. 

I went to work every day and returned home at night as a delivery man to earn extra money for my living. One day, when I got sick, I sent all my money back to my hometown. I didn't have a few hundred left. I had to try my best to come home from work in the storm to deliver goods to earn money for food, but I didn't complain even once.

Yet, no matter how small or big, my family calls me complaining of suffering and needing money.

I don't know if there is anyone like me, but I'm really afraid of receiving calls from my family, or going home to visit.","Áp lực từ phía gia đình. Chào mọi người , vào thẳng vấn đề lun.

Gia đình tôi thì không được khá giả , làm nông . Khi học hết 12 tôi phải lên thành phố kiếm tiền gửi về cho gia đình, tôi cũng mong ước được đi học đại học như bao người khác .

Rồi từ đợt covid tôi có tiết kiệm được số tiền quay trở lại con đường học, tôi cố gắn vừa làm vừa học , gia đình tôi thì vẫn thế chả giúp đỡ được tôi gì nhiều cả, mà lúc nào cũng gọi lên hay than vãn về đủ thứ việc trong gia đình .

Sau tôi cũng ra trường rồi , mỗi tháng vẫn thế tôi có gửi về gia đình, nhưng những cuộc gọi than vãn ấy không bao giờ hết . 

Tôi ngày đi làm tối về đi shipper kiếm thêm cho cuộc sống, có hôm tôi bệnh tiền thì đã gửi về quê hết, trong người chẳng còn nổi vài trăm , tôi phải cố gắn đi làm về dầm mưa giông mà giao hàng kiếm tiền ăn, nhưng tôi chẳng hề than cực lấy một tiếng .

Ấy vậy mà nhà tôi cứ chuyện bé , chuyện lớn gì đều gọi điện cho tôi than khổ ,cần tiền.

Không biết có bác nào như tôi không , chứ tôi thật sự sợ nghe cuộc gọi từ gia đình , hay là việc về thăm nhà.","pressure from family . hello everyone , straight point . my family not well off , we farmer . when i finish 12th grade , i have go city earn money send back my family . i also wish go university like everyone else . then after covid period , i save up money go back school . i try work study same time . my family still couldn't help me much , always call complain about all kind family matter . after i graduate , i send message my family every month , those complain call never stop . i go work every day return home night a a delivery man earn extra money my living . one day , when i get sick , i send all my money back my hometown . i didn't have a few hundred leave . i have try my best come home from work storm deliver good earn money food , i didn't complain even once . yet , no matter how small big , my family call me complain suffering need money . i don't know if there anyone like me , i'm really afraid receive call from my family , go home visit .",Normal

1oer58u,1761290025.0,2025-10-24 07:13:45,"""In Vietnam it's better than in the US"" - a sentence that sounds both stupid and ridiculous. I'll be honest, every time I hear Vietnamese people say ""it's better in Vietnam than America, America is so much better, I'd rather stay in Vietnam to be comfortable"" I can only sigh. Saying it like that proves you guys have never lived there, never knew what ""happiness"" really is, and most importantly - you're familiar with suffering, then lull yourself into thinking you're happy.

In America, people live by real labor. Do more, get more, do less, get less. clear and fair, there is no such thing as ""flattery to get promoted"" or ""lubrication to keep the seat"". In Vietnam, people work 12 hours for less than 10 dollars; As for the guy sitting in the air conditioner, saying a few words, he won tens of millions. Yet there are still people who say ""Vietnam is better than America""? Oh, where is the happiness? Even though you're being exploited, you still have to laugh?

When you come to America, no one cares who you were or what seat you used to sit in. No one has time to ask, ""What position did you hold in Vietnam, who did you know, where did your family live?"" There is only one question here: ""What can you do now?"".
In Vietnam, you can be ""the director"", ""the department head"", ""the big boss"", ""this guy's nephew, that guy's acquaintance"". But when I came to America, everyone committed suicide to 0. It doesn't matter what degree you have. As long as you can do the job, people will respect you. If you can't do it, go somewhere else. That's called true justice.

Many Vietnamese and American people were shocked by that. In Vietnam, I'm used to being greeted by people saying ""yes boss"", ""hello director"", over here no one even glances at me, no one calls me ""boss"", no one serves me. Suddenly I feel like I'm being ""looked down on"" and ""devalued"". but no, no one looks down on you — people just don't value the past, only look at the present. Here, respect is not bought by position, not by money, but by the way you live, the way you do.

There are people who come to America and see that they have to carry food, clear tables, wash dishes, do warehouse work, and do nails - and they feel self-conscious. “I used to be a manager in Vietnam, how did I come here to do these things?”
Sorry, that's the mindset of poor people who think they're rich.
In America, you are respected no matter what you do, as long as you do it properly. Picking up trash, cutting grass, making fast food, everyone has insurance, rights, and a clear salary. No one despises you because you work with your hands. In Vietnam, there is a style of ""looking down on workers"", ""only respecting the rich, respecting the cool guy"".

also said ""in Vietnam it's more comfortable, in the US it's very tiring"" - tiring is true, but it's worth it. In America, you plow a lot, you have a house, a car, insurance, and a future. In Vietnam, after several years of plowing, you are still poor, but if you open your mouth to complain, you will be cursed ""because you don't try"". Coming to America, no one teaches morality, no one blames you - just do it, money will come to your pocket. It's that simple.

To be honest, I don't criticize my homeland, but I'm tired of meaningless illusions and pride. Some people keep saying ""it's fun in Vietnam, there's no pressure like in America"". That's right, I'm happy because my parents take care of me, I'm happy because I still have meals prepared at home, I'm happy because I don't have to do my own laundry or pay my own bills, I'm happy because I have someone to take care of every little thing. But that's not ""happiness"" - that's dependence.
Coming to America, you have to do everything yourself. laundry, cooking, washing dishes, taking out the trash, going to work, paying taxes, studying law. everything is self-motivated. Can't stand it? Well, don't open your mouth and say ""Vietnam is better"". The happiness you talk about is just happiness because you are lazy, because you are used to being pampered, because you have never truly lived independently.

The funniest thing is that many people in Vietnam have heard about going to America to ""work as a waiter, a nail technician, or a market worker"" and then criticize: ""Oh my god, going there is so cruel, doing those things is so embarrassing."" Oh, where's the shame? People work honestly, support themselves, send money home, buy houses, raise children, and live decent lives. And you guys in Vietnam sit in cafes, complaining about life, talking about morality, while you don't even have enough money for gas in your pocket. Who is more shameful?

In America, whoever is diligent, whoever is wise, whoever knows how to take advantage of opportunities will live well. Every month people move their house and fill it with good things: TVs, air conditioners, tables and chairs, electronics, even iPhones and laptops that are in good condition. Whoever is quick to collect them, wash them, post them for sale, will get a few hundred dollars. While in Vietnam, when we see people picking up things, we criticize them, ""It's so weird, it's so humiliating,"" and then we stay poor. In America, people call it ""recycle"" - in Vietnam we call it ""picking up scraps"". same action, different head.

You people in Vietnam say ""here is better than America"" because you have never dared to live truly, never dared to be independent. In Vietnam, we are used to being called ""Mr. This, Mrs. That"", used to being served by others, used to saying ""someone will take care of you"". When you come to America, no one cares about you, no one cares about who you used to be. Here, if you can do it you will live, if you cannot do it you will die. that's the reality.

I'll make it clear: in America","Ở Việt Nam sướng hơn Mỹ” – cái câu nghe vừa ngu vừa nực cười. Tao nói thật, mỗi lần nghe mấy đứa Việt Nam mở miệng bảo “ở Việt Nam sướng hơn Mỹ, bên Mỹ cực lắm, tao thà ở Việt Nam cho thoải mái” là tao chỉ biết thở dài. Nói như vậy chứng tỏ tụi mày chưa từng sống bên đó, chưa từng biết “sướng” thật sự là gì, và quan trọng nhất – tụi mày quen với khổ, rồi tự ru mình là đang sướng.

Ở Mỹ, người ta sống bằng lao động thật. Làm nhiều hưởng nhiều, làm ít hưởng ít. Rõ ràng, công bằng, không có chuyện “nịnh bợ để lên chức”, “bôi trơn để giữ ghế”. Ở Việt Nam, thằng làm quần quật 12 tiếng, lương chưa tới 10 đô; còn thằng ngồi máy lạnh, nói vài câu, ăn mấy chục triệu. Vậy mà vẫn có người nói “ở Việt Nam sướng hơn Mỹ”? Ủa, sướng ở chỗ nào? Ở cái chỗ bị bóc lột mà vẫn phải cười hả?

Qua Mỹ, không ai quan tâm mày từng là ai, từng ngồi ghế gì. Không ai rảnh hỏi “hồi ở Việt Nam mày làm chức gì, quen ai, nhà mày ở đâu”. Ở đây chỉ có một câu hỏi duy nhất: “Giờ mày làm được gì?”.
Ở Việt Nam, mày có thể là “ông giám đốc”, “bà trưởng phòng”, “ông sếp lớn”, “cháu ông này, người quen bà nọ”. Nhưng khi qua Mỹ, tất cả đều reset về 0. Mày có bằng gì cũng mặc kệ, miễn làm được việc thì người ta tôn trọng, không làm được thì đi chỗ khác. Đó mới gọi là công bằng thật sự.

Nhiều người Việt qua Mỹ bị sốc vì cái đó. Ở Việt Nam quen được người khác chào “dạ sếp”, “chào anh giám đốc”, qua bên đây không ai thèm liếc nhìn, không ai gọi “sếp”, không ai bưng bê hầu hạ. Tự nhiên thấy mình bị “coi thường”, “mất giá”. Nhưng không, không ai coi thường mày cả — người ta chỉ không coi trọng quá khứ, chỉ nhìn hiện tại. Ở đây, tôn trọng không mua bằng chức, không mua bằng tiền, mà mua bằng cách mày sống, cách mày làm.

Có người qua Mỹ, thấy phải bưng bê, dọn bàn, rửa chén, làm kho, làm nail — liền tự ái. “Tao từng là quản lý ở Việt Nam, sao qua đây làm mấy việc này được?”
Xin lỗi, đó là tư tưởng của mấy người nghèo mà tưởng mình sang.
Ở Mỹ, mày làm gì cũng được tôn trọng, miễn là mày làm đàng hoàng. Nhặt rác, cắt cỏ, làm fast food, ai cũng có bảo hiểm, có quyền, có lương rõ ràng. Không ai khinh mày vì mày làm việc tay chân cả. Ở Việt Nam mới có kiểu “coi thường người lao động”, “chỉ trọng thằng giàu, trọng thằng ngồi mát”.

Còn nói “ở Việt Nam thoải mái hơn, bên Mỹ mệt lắm” — mệt là đúng, nhưng mệt đáng. Bên Mỹ, mày cày nhiều, mày có nhà, có xe, có bảo hiểm, có tương lai. Ở Việt Nam, cày mấy năm vẫn nghèo, mà mở miệng than thì bị chửi “do mày không cố gắng”. Qua Mỹ, không ai dạy đạo lý, không ai đổ lỗi cho mày – chỉ cần làm, tiền sẽ về túi mày. Đơn giản vậy thôi.

Nói thật, tao không chê quê hương, nhưng tao chán cái kiểu ảo tưởng và tự hào vô nghĩa. Mấy đứa cứ nói “ở Việt Nam sướng, không áp lực như bên Mỹ”. Đúng rồi, sướng vì có cha mẹ lo, sướng vì ở nhà vẫn có cơm dọn sẵn, sướng vì không phải tự giặt đồ, tự trả hóa đơn, sướng vì có người lo cho từng thứ nhỏ. Nhưng đó không phải “sướng” – đó là phụ thuộc.
Qua Mỹ, mày phải tự làm tất cả. Giặt đồ, nấu ăn, rửa chén, đổ rác, đi làm, đóng thuế, học luật. Tất cả là tự thân vận động. Không chịu nổi à? Thì thôi, đừng mở miệng nói “Việt Nam sướng hơn”. Cái sướng mà mày nói chỉ là sướng vì lười, vì quen được nuông chiều, vì chưa bao giờ thật sự sống độc lập.

Mà mắc cười nhất là có nhiều người ở Việt Nam nghe nói qua Mỹ “làm bưng bê, làm nail, làm chợ” thì chê bai: “Trời ơi, qua đó cực dữ lắm, làm mấy việc đó xấu hổ lắm.” Ủa, xấu hổ chỗ nào? Người ta làm việc chân chính, tự nuôi thân, gửi tiền về, mua được nhà, nuôi được con, sống đàng hoàng. Còn tụi mày ở Việt Nam ngồi quán cà phê, than đời, nói chuyện đạo lý, trong khi trong túi còn không đủ tiền đổ xăng. Ai đáng xấu hổ hơn ai?

Bên Mỹ, ai siêng, ai khôn, ai biết tận dụng cơ hội thì sống tốt. Mỗi tháng người ta dọn nhà, bỏ ra đầy đồ tốt: tivi, máy lạnh, bàn ghế, đồ điện tử, thậm chí iPhone, laptop còn xài ngon. Ai nhanh mắt gom lại, rửa sạch, đăng bán, là có vài trăm đô. Trong khi ở Việt Nam, thấy người ta nhặt đồ là chê, “kỳ quá, nhục quá”, rồi nghèo hoài. Ở Mỹ, người ta gọi đó là “recycle” – ở Việt Nam tụi mày gọi là “lượm ve chai”. Cùng một hành động, khác nhau ở cái đầu.

Tụi mày ở Việt Nam nói “ở đây sướng hơn Mỹ” là vì tụi mày chưa bao giờ dám sống thật, chưa bao giờ dám tự lập. Ở Việt Nam, tụi mày quen được gọi “ông này, bà nọ”, quen được người khác phục vụ, quen nói miệng “có người lo”. Qua Mỹ, không ai lo cho mày đâu, không ai quan tâm mày từng là ai. Ở đây, làm được thì sống, không làm được thì gục. Đó mới là thực tế.

Tao nói cho rõ luôn: bên Mỹ cực, nhưng công bằng. Ở Việt Nam đỡ cực hơn, nhưng bất công. Mày chọn cái nào? Một nơi mày bị bóp nghẹt nhưng tưởng mình yên ổn, hay một nơi mày phải cố gắng nhưng có cơ hội thật sự?
Ở Mỹ, người ta tôn trọng người lao động. Ở Việt Nam, người ta tôn trọng tiền, dù tiền đó có từ đâu cũng mặc. Thế thì “sướng hơn Mỹ” kiểu gì?

⸻

Kết lại:
Nếu tụi mày thật sự tin “Việt Nam sướng hơn Mỹ”, thì cứ ở đó mà “sướng”. Cứ tin rằng ngồi uống cà phê, tám chuyện chính trị, khoe chức danh là “cuộc sống đáng mơ ước”.
Còn những người bên Mỹ, dù họ bưng bê, rửa chén, nhặt đồ, làm kho, vẫn đáng nể hơn – vì họ sống thật, làm thật, kiếm đồng tiền sạch, và tự đứng trên đôi chân mình.

Ở Việt Nam, nhiều người làm dáng như quý tộc, nhưng thật ra chỉ đang nghèo trong im lặng và tự lừa mình là hạnh phúc.
Còn ở Mỹ, người ta làm người thật sự – không cần danh, không cần nịnh – chỉ cần có giá trị.

1j8msx3,1741685251.0,2025-03-11 09:27:31,"Why are Vietnamese intellectuals now all from the North? ""Boleros are so stupid at studying"". I saw it on the thread so it's so annoying. It is a fact that the majority of Vietnamese intellectuals in Vietnam now are from the North. Scholarships are also in the hands of northerners. Diplomatic positions are the same, all of them. 

Is it possible that male people are stupid and abandon their mothers, as the others say?

The truth is that after 1975, southern intellectuals were all imprisoned and exterminated. In 1980, she was banned from taking university entrance exams because of her fake background. only quit later. At that time, the new intellectual class was in the hands of the northerners. 

The same goes for the achievements they often use for masturbation. 

The road to the top of Olympia was also made up of Northerners. Because basically, Vinh Long is banned from taking the exam. Gradually, men no longer care. 

National excellent students and the Olympic team are also from the North. Because teachers from the North are the ones who set the questions. If you want to win, you have to hire him to accompany you. That's why achievements always belong to northerners. 

The current situation is the result of the policy of attacking the bourgeoisie and eliminating southern intellectuals after 1975, not that northerners are better.

Không lẽ dân Nam ngu dốt bỏ mẹ, như tụi kia nói?

Sự thật là sau 1975, dân trí thức miền Nam bị bỏ tù và triệt hạ hết rồi. Cô chưa tao hồi 1980 bị cấm thi đại học vì lý lịch Nguỵ. Sau này mới bỏ. Lúc đó thì tầng lớp trí thức mới đã vô tay dân Bắc.

1pufy7e,1766555616.0,2025-12-24 05:53:36,"anonymous or not anonymous? 
Hey guys, it's been a while since I've posted a post, because I was taking advantage of a stupid guy who thought he created a clone account on Ytb = anonymously, a group of people in here were threatened to pee so they went out at night with their chips =)))))))))))))) Well, there are a bunch of pig birds lying around, so here we go

I'll try to keep it brief for non-experts, because 1, I'm not an expert, and 2, I'm not an expert (to some extent). My background is not in network engineering or anything like that, so this article will follow the investigator's mindset so we can understand the nature of this case. I will summarize below the tiktok version of this article for those who are lazy to read, because I wrote it and found it dry with so many jargon =))))

Let's go straight to the most important issue, does Google (and its ecosystem) go with the trick?
yes and no. Google does not cooperate with the government in the sense of political support or selling information (like Facebook), and does not even have special privileges because of doing business in Vietnam. But it doesn't mean that Google will defend us completely, because even Google's public policy also announces that it will cooperate in providing a certain amount of information to the host company if the conditions according to Google's policy are met.
Vietnam's legal framework also has provisions requiring businesses to provide information (anm 2018, ND-53/2022, ND-147/2024). Especially Decree 53 expands details on the types of data that need to be stored and especially extends the retention period to at least 24 months, which means that by the time the government hunts us down, it will be too late to lock Facebook.
Don't criticize, in theory (in theory), such a request is not excessive, nor is it rare. Many countries also have similar regulations, at least about 18 countries from Asia to Europe have requirements to store data domestically and cooperate in providing information when needed. However, it is not easy to force Google to vomit information, especially in a country with a bad reputation for internal politics like Vietnam. That request must still comply with gg's global policy that spells meet legal procedures and international standards (for example ecpa or gni). In fact, Google has received a lot of requests from vn chips, nma is almost ignored. According to freedom house sources, most of the requests received and implemented are removal requests, but requests for information are rarely agreed to.
What does that mean? That means you can't live like an animal and expect people to treat you like a human being. Google doesn't go against the communists, but it also doesn't defend the animals, like a crazy guy threatening to bomb the airport and clearly stating his motive for asking for money (not to mention whether it's a joke or not). There's no need to know too much, with normal thinking people at ibay already see that this is an extremely serious case of security, red alert, then Google is very happy to vomit all the information to the police and throw this loz in jail or 15 years to remember.

He doesn't interfere in politics like this guy is cursing Phuong Vin, you're throwing up his home address for me, but you're cursing Phuong Vin + threatening to plant a chemical bomb at the new car show with the date and time of the action and the declaration ""Prosperity will be blamed""

So Google can get your information, and can provide it in some cases. But how safe is that, right?
Because you are not Google's cskh or a doctor of law to know which of your actions online will not fall into the provision policy, or whether any of your information has been leaked, and how to remove fingerprints when logging in. This is a super summary of network information investigation techniques, and as I said from the beginning, I'm not a professional so I'll just write what I know.
So what is anonymity? My point is that there is no such thing as complete anonymity, especially on social networks. I will immediately use Google as an example:

For example, you guys are stupid enough to listen to a pig bird up here threatening to bomb the country. So what will Google have in hand to provide to CP? (In case cp only plays nicely solo = current rules, not talking about going through the back door)
It includes: IP address, cookies, data device fingerprint which act as ""ingredients"" and manual investigation is to cook those ingredients into a cake to offer to whoever is stupid enough to be exposed.

First, any comment on YouTube is tied to the logged in Google account. You can't comment if you don't create an account. Google records IP addresses and device information during each login and comment. When investigating, we can ask Google to provide that IP with time, and the ISP will have to provide it.","Ẩn danh hay không ẩn danh? 
Lô tụi bây, lâu rồi mới ngoi lên có 1 bài, tại đang nhân dịp có thằng ngu tưởng nó tạo 1 tài khoản clone trên YTB = ẩn danh xong 1 đám trong này bị dọa té đái là GG đi đêm với chú phỉnh =)))))))))))))) à trong đó có đám chim lợn nằm vùng lòe tụi mày nữa, nên here we go

T sẽ cố gắng nói ngắn gọn cho người không chuyên, vì 1 là tụi m không chuyên, 2 là t không chuyên (ở mức nào đấy). Background của t ko chuyên về kỹ thuật mạng hay cái gì tương tự vậy, nên bài này sẽ theo hướng mindset của điều tra viên để tụi m hiểu bản chất vụ lần này thôi. T sẽ tóm tắt dưới còm phiên bản tiktok của cái bài này cho đứa nào lười đọc, tại t viết t còn thấy nó khô khan với thuật ngữ nhiều vl =))))

Vào thẳng cái vấn đề được quan tâm nhất luôn, Google (và hệ sinh thái của nó) có đi đêm với chú phỉnh không?
Có và không. Google không đi đêm với chính phủ theo cái nghĩa là ủng hộ chính trị hay bán thông tin (như facebook), thậm chí cả sự ưu tiên đặc quyền vì kinh doanh tại VN cũng không có. Nhưng nó không có nghĩa là Google sẽ bảo vệ tụi bây hoàn toàn, vì ngay cả chính sách công khai của Google cũng thông báo sẽ hợp tác cung cấp một lượng thông tin nào đó cho CP sở tại nếu thỏa các điều kiện theo chính sách của Google.
Khung pháp lý của VN cũng có những điều khoản yêu cầu các doanh nghiệp cung cấp TT (ANM 2018, NĐ-53/2022,NĐ-147/2024). Đặc biệt là NĐ53 mở rộng chi tiết về các loại dữ liệu cần lưu trữ và đặc biệt nới thời gian lưu giữ ra ít nhất 24 tháng, nghĩa là tới khi chính phủ săn tụi m mới lo khóa fb thì quá muộn cmnr
Khoan chỉ trích, về lý thuyết (lý thuyết nhá) thì yêu cầu như vậy không quá đáng, cũng ko hiếm. Rất nhiều nước cũng có quy định tương tự, ít nhất khoảng 18 quốc gia từ á sang âu đều có yêu cầu lưu trữ dữ liệu tại trong nước và hợp tác cung cấp thông tin khi cần. Tuy nhiên để bắt thằng Google ói info ra cũng ko dễ, nhất là với cái quốc gia thuộc nhóm có tiếng xấu về nội chính trị như VN. Yêu cầu đó vẫn phải tuân thủ theo chính sách toàn cầu của GG là chú phỉnh đáp ứng đủ thủ tục pháp lý và chuẩn mực quốc tế (ECPA hoặc GNI chẳng hạn). Thực tế Google đã nhận rất nhiều yêu cầu từ chú phỉnh VN, nma gần như bơ hết. THeo nguồn Freedom House thì đa phần yêu cầu được nhận và thực hiện là yêu cầu gỡ bỏ chứ còn yêu cầu cung cấp thông tin rất hiếm khi được đồng ý.
Tức là sao? Tức là tụi mày không thể sống như một con súc vật mà đòi người ta đối xử như một con người. Google không đi đêm với CPVN, nhưng nó cũng không bảo vệ tụi súc vật, như 1 thằng khùng đe dọa đánh bom sân bay và nói rõ động cơ đòi tiền (chưa bàn tới nó đùa hay thật nhé). Khỏi cần phải hiểu biết quá nhiều chi, tư duy bình thường tụ ibay đã thấy đây là case cực nghiêm trọng về an ninh, red alert luôn, thì Google rất hân hoan ói hết thông tin cho tụi công an tống thằng loz này vô tù hoặc 15 củ cho nhớ.

Nó không can thiệp vào việc chính trị theo kiểu alo thằng loz này đang chửi vượng vin, tụi bây ói địa chỉ nhà nó ra cho tao, nhưng tụi bây chửi vượng vin + đe dọa cài bom hóa học ở triển lãm xe mới kèm theo ngày giờ hành động và tuyên ngôn ""Vượng vin sẽ phải đổ máo"" thì có

Vậy là Google có thể có được thông tin của tụi mày, và có thể cung cấp trong một vài trường hợp. Nhưng mà như vậy thì an toàn chó gì nữa đúng không?
Vì tụi mày không phải CSKH của Google hay tiến sĩ luật để biết hành động nào của tụi m trên mạng sẽ không rớt vô cái chính sách cung cấp, hay liệu thông tin nào của tụi bay đã bị lộ, và làm sao để xóa fingerprint khi ấn danh. Thì đây là phần siêu siêu tóm tắt của kỹ thuật điều tra thông tin mạng, và như t nói từ đầu, t không phải dân chuyên nên t chỉ viết theo cái t biết nhé
Vậy thì ẩn danh là gì? Quan điểm của t là không có sự ẩn danh hoàn toàn, nhất là trên MXH. T sẽ lấy ngay luôn Google làm ví dụ :

Vd tụi mày ngu sao đó nghe theo 1 con chim lợn trên này đi dọa đánh bom vượng vin đi. Thì Google sẽ có những gì trong tay để cung cấp cho CP? (trong trường hợp CP chỉ chơi đẹp solo = luật hiện hành nhé, k nói tới đi cửa sau)
Nó gồm : Địa chỉ IP, cookie, data device fingerprint đóng vai trò là ""nguyên liệu"" và điều tra thủ công chính là cook đống nguyên liệu đó thành 1 cái bánh để cúng thằng nào đủ ngu bị lộ

Đầu tiên, bất kỳ cmt nào trên YTB đều gắn với tài khoản GG đã đăng nhập. Tụi mày không thể comment nếu không tạo tài khoản. Google ghi nhận địa chỉ IP và thông tin thiết bị trong mỗi lần đăng nhập và bình luận. Khi cần điều tra, tụi can có thể yêu cầu Google cung cấp IP đó kèm thời gian còm, còn nhà mạng (ISP) sẽ phải cung cấp danh tính thuê bao tương ứng với IP đó theo lệnh tòa. Dữ liệu IP cho phép ước tính vị trí hoặc tìm ra người dùng, kể cả khi IP là động vì các nhà mạng lưu nhật ký kết nối của khách. Dùng wifi nhà/4g sim chính chủ thì địt mẹ 5 tiếng thôi ăn gậy ngay
Tiếp theo là cookie. Google sử dụng cookie và các dữ liệu nhận dạng thiết bị (data device fingerprint) để theo dõi hoạt động của tụi m, ví dụ đăng nhập = trình duyệt nào, thiết bị nào, ở đâu. Cái này không phải hù, tụi m có thể tự xem lịch sử đăng nhập/thiết bị trên chính tài khoản tụi m thì Google nó còn coi được tới cái gì?
Khi kết hợp IP với cookie, thông tin trình duyệt, lịch sử đăng nhập và hoạt động (Google biết mail, sđt đã đăng ký cho tài khoản đó), có thể liên kết các bình luận với một cá nhân cụ thể/khoanh vùng để điều tra thủ công. IP sẽ cung cấp ước lượng vị trí, thông tin thanh toán sẽ cung cấp........gần như tất cả, còn DDF sẽ là bằng chứng vật lý nếu cần ra tòa. Thông tin này dĩ nhiên là bảo mật nhưng sẽ phải cung cấp nếu có trát của tòa. Sử dụng VPN hay Tor để ẩn IP hả? Đéo có nhà cung cấp nào có thể từ chối ói thông tin nếu chính phủ có lý do đủ mạnh, như là đánh bom chẳng hạn.Và chủ VPN có thể cung cấp nhật ký kết nối để tìm địa chỉ gốc
Tài khoản thì ẩn danh nhưng thực chất backend hoặc những thứ tụi tạo ra sự ẩn danh đó vẫn để lại dấu vết như dùng tên nhưng login = cùng thiết bị hay tk có liên kết đến danh tính thật (mail, đthoai, tài khoản MXH khác), hay để lộ thông tin cá nhân khi cmt, nên làm ơn hãy tìm hiểu và đừng tự đưa bản thân vào tầm ngắm.

Còn đây là 1 vài chia sẻ. Tip trick, kiểu kiểu thế
Nếu thực sự cần bảo đảm riêng tư tối đa, tụi m cần hình dung 1 tài khoản ẩn danh (t sẽ dùng google làm ví dụ) thường sẽ có những thứ không ẩn danh sau :
- Địa chỉ IP khi đăng ký/sử dụng. Nghĩa là đăng ký là lộ, cmt là lộ. Cái này có thể dùng VPN hoặc ẩn IP, khá đơn giản
- Fingerprint thiết bị, là loại máy, mã máy, loại trình duyệt tụi m sử dụng. Cái này nếu không nghiêm trọng thì sử dụng 2-3 máy, cô lập máy là được, hoặc tốt nhất là dùng máy công cộng như net sẽ ngắt quãng truy vết
- Cookie, AID. Android trùm cmnl : cái này chỉ có nước reset AID định kì, kiểm soát các app nào đang quảng cáo và chặn coookie bên thứ ba nếu cần
- Email khôi phục, SĐT : Không tái sử dụng email/sđt cá nhân cho tài khoản clone, tách mail đăng ký, mail khôi phục và hạn chế nhất có thể SĐT. Tụi m có thể tham khảo protonmail, nó đky = số ảo được. Dùng mail ảo đăng ký bằng số ảo để tạo tài khoản ảo và ko log chéo giữa acc ảo và acc thật

Tóm lại, không có gì là ẩn danh hoàn toàn cả nhưng cũng không phải mặc định GG đi đêm với cảng. Đừng cho cảng có lý do đủ chính đáng để google phải hợp tác, còn lại ẩn danh thông minh vào vẫn là phương án đấu tranh tốt nhất cho anh em","anonymous not anonymous ? hey guy , it's a while since i've post a post , because i take advantage a stupid guy who think he create a clone account ytb = anonymously , a group people here threaten pee they go out night their chip =)))))))))))))) well , there a bunch pig bird lie around , here we go i'll try keep brief non - expert , because 1 , i'm not an expert , 2 , i'm not an expert ( some extent ). my background not network engineering anything like , article will follow investigator's mindset we can understand nature case . i will summarize below tiktok version article those who lazy read , because i write find dry many jargon =)))) let's go straight most important issue , do google ( ecosystem ) go trick ? yes no . google do not cooperate government sense political support selling information ( like facebook ), do not even have special privilege because do business vietnam . doesn't mean google will defend u completely , because even google's public policy also announce will cooperate provide a certain amount information host company if condition accord google's policy meet . vietnam's legal framework also have provision require business provide information ( anm 2018 , nd - 53 / 2022 , nd - 147 / 2024 ). especially decree 53 expands detail type data need store especially extend retention period least 24 month , which mean time government hunt u down , will too late lock facebook . don't criticize , theory ( theory ), such a request not excessive , nor rare . many country also have similar regulation , least about 18 country from asia europe have requirement store data domestically cooperate provide information when need . however , not easy force google vomit information , especially a country a bad reputation internal politics like vietnam . request must still comply gg's global policy spell meet legal procedure international standard ( example ecpa gni ). fact , google have receive a lot request from vn chip , nma almost ignore . accord freedom house source , most request receive implement removal request , request information rarely agree . what do mean ? mean you can't live like an animal expect people treat you like a human . google doesn't go against communist , also doesn't defend animal , like a crazy guy threaten bomb airport clearly state his motive ask money ( not mention whether it's a joke not ). there's no need know too much , normal think people ibay already see an extremely serious case security , red alert , then google very happy vomit all information police throw loz jail 15 year remember . he doesn't interfere politics like guy curse phuong vin , you're throw up his home address me , you're curse phuong vin + threaten plant a chemical bomb new car show date time action declaration "" prosperity will blame "" google can get your information , can provide some case . how safe , right ? because you not google's cskh a doctor law know which your action online will not fall into provision policy , whether any your information have leak , how remove fingerprint when log . a super summary network information investigation technique , a i say from beginning , i'm not a professional i'll just write what i know . what anonymity ? my point there no such thing a complete anonymity , especially social network . i will immediately use google a an example : example , you guy stupid enough listen a pig bird up here threaten bomb country . what will google have hand provide cp ?

I lived in Ho Chi Minh City and when I was in 7th grade, I didn't have much contact with anyone, so I thought I wouldn't be bullied. Who would have thought that while studying, people around me would kick me in the back when I couldn't stand it anymore, then I took my pen and stabbed that guy in the arm and from then on, I stopped kicking myself ;))))).

  
and many more times he took my water bottle, stole it, hid it in the classroom and at the end of the 2nd semester, I failed the physics exam so I took the exam again, luckily I passed and he bullied me so I was left to stay. I felt so happy at that time, it was like god punishing that little shit head.

And I was bullied many times in high school, but that person was transferred to another school because he hit me, but I coaxed him to hit me when there were many witnesses and he was kept in the same class. From then on, the whole class stayed away from me and didn't want to have contact with me, but I also liked it so I no longer had to listen to them dare to say bad things to me.

I go to school 4 times a week and every day I take the bus (I live in Houston without a car so going to school and the gym takes a lot longer than usual) It's almost 1 hour and 50 minutes so getting home is already a lot of work 💀😭 My uncle keeps forcing me to go get nail salons with her but I feel like the nail salon environment isn't suitable for me, my aunt also has a bit of racist thoughts towards customers. I'm black so I'm not comfortable working with her. 

Every time we eat at home, my uncle brings up the story of how he crossed the border here when he was 19 and started working, so he wants me to do the same. My uncle is upset with my lifestyle where I only go to school and go to the gym, and occasionally go out with friends. Even though I explained that I applied for 10 on campus jobs, the problem is that I didn't get hired, so I feel like he doesn't understand that dhs have the option to work on campus? My family created enough conditions for me to focus on studying and then find a job later, and I'm grateful for that because I don't have to pressure myself to earn money, but sometimes when I talk to my uncle, I feel like he's jealous because I don't have to work hard to start over like him. My uncle also lied that every month my mother sent $100 in rent to pressure me to work, even though my mother confirmed that was not the case. 

My family also applied for immigration through my aunt and uncle's sponsorship, so I wanted to focus on uni, finish school, then go to work to make it easier for the family to build a foundation. I'm also looking for some pho restaurants to serve, but I'm afraid that taking on too much will make me stressed, and if so, I'm afraid my GPA won't be high and if my family finds out, they'll be very upset. I only stayed for 1 more year and next year I transferred to the dorm, does anyone have any tips to help me talk slowly with him? 💀 I'm not stressed about studying, but I'm also stressed about being forced to work undercover.

1e9i9go,1721664964.0,2024-07-22 16:16:04,"confiding that I am a student, I feel like I am a person with low self-esteem. I really admire confident people around me. The way they assert themselves that they will definitely achieve their goals is really great, they affirm what they want, what they like. I have low self-esteem so I don't dare to say anything I like to do, I don't dare to affirm that I will achieve my goals, I don't dare to speak up about my needs. Because I feel like if I make such an assertion, what if I can't do it? I always think I can't do it. And in reality, maybe I really don't have the capacity to do it.

I'm currently about to participate in an exam, my entire team consists of 5 people. This is a large number compared to other teams. and in fact, I'm afraid I was eliminated before starting to review. At first I accepted it, but was still sad because I thought I was weak. I cried, but then I was asked by the teacher, ""Do you still want to study?"". After thinking for a while, I thought I might not be able to take the exam but I wanted to have the knowledge. so I agree. At first, I cried so much because I felt like I was so bad. According to you, I wondered if I made the right choice? Because studying for exams takes a lot of time and you will miss out on knowledge in class. 

I feel stubborn. I don't know when I became so self-conscious and believed that I was weak. Previously, I was also a good student and achieved high achievements. But when I entered a new environment, I realized that I was just a grain of sand and I was under peer pressure. There was a time when I wanted to rise up to assert myself, but I felt like a fish floundering on the ground. 

Looking at my friends who are better than me, I just told myself that I have to try and learn. But on the other hand, he's also sad and jealous. I want to give up. I'm sure everyone is worried, but everyone exudes confidence, everyone firmly affirms that they will win a high prize, which makes me feel very pressured. I wonder, why are people so ambitious? I also want myself to be confident and dare to be ambitious and dream big. but I'm still afraid. The friends around me encouraged me that in their eyes I was also very good so there was no need to compare myself to others. But I can't stop myself, I feel like I'm bad, I feel like I don't have any talent or ability, I have low self-esteem. 

I often look for someone to listen to me, but actually I'm looking for recognition. I don't recognize myself so I have to find it in others. But even if I received their verbal recognition, I still wouldn't believe it. 

Someone told me to believe in myself, look back at the achievements I have achieved! I think that those past achievements now have no meaning at all. 

I admire and at the same time feel negative pressure. I tried to encourage myself, just keep studying and you'll get there wherever you go. But what if I study forever but am not as good as anyone else? What if I study but I have nothing? If I fail, will I cry? What should I do if I cannot confirm that I have the ability? People say to me, what if I feel embarrassed? What if my parents are disappointed in me? 

Even though I determined that I was studying just to gain knowledge, if everyone passed, I would be the only one who failed. At that time, I lost all my optimism and joy. Do you cry and blame yourself for being useless? I just hope that if I fail miserably, I won't be sad, I still believe that I still have value, I just haven't realized that value yet. Every person has their own values. 

Today I still review and study but I feel confused. What if I fail again? If I'm not good at this, I'm good at something else, but besides this, what else can I do?

Some people advise you to look at your strengths, but I can't see that I'm strong at anything. Advise me that there are actually many things I can do that others can't, but I feel that if people just try a little, they can surpass me. 

I'm afraid that others will praise me for my hard work. I'm afraid that if I work hard I still won't achieve anything. I'm afraid my hard work is redundant. But I don't have the ability or intelligence to be good at anything quickly like other people. 

But I believe that everything will pass. I hope that I will find a way to be free, happy, and comfortable in my thinking. 

I don't want to be under negative pressure. 

I want to live happily and happily without needing achievements or recognition. If you want to get better, you have to be confident, believe that you have value, and don't be afraid when you see other people's confidence and ambition. Don't be too pressured when you see other people's achievements. no one dies at all","Tâm sự Em đang là học sinh, em cảm thấy em là 1 người đang tự ti về bản thân. Em rất ngưỡng mộ những người tự tin xung quanh mình. Cái cách họ khẳng định bản thân chắc chắn họ sẽ làm được mục tiêu của họ thật sự rất là tuyệt vời, họ khẳng định điều họ muốn, điều họ thích. Còn e tự ti nên thích làm gì cũng không dám nói ra, e không dám khẳng định bản thân sẽ làm được những mục tiêu của mình, e không dám nói lên nhu cầu của e. Bởi e cảm thấy nếu mình khẳng định như thế nếu không làm được thì sao? E luôn nghĩ bản thân không thể làm được đâu. Và thực tế thì có lẽ e thực sự không đủ năng lực để làm.

Hiện tại e sắp tham gia một kì thi, đội tuyển cả tinh cả e gồm có 5 người. Đây là một con số nhiều nếu so với các đội tuyển khác. Và thực ra e là người đã bị loại trước khi bắt đầu ôn tập. Ban đầu e đã chấp nhận, nhưng vẫn buồn vì nghĩ bản thân yếu kém. e khóc, nhưng sau đó e được giáo viên hỏi ""em còn muốn ôn không?"". Sau 1 hồi nghĩ, e nghĩ rằng mình có thể không thi được nhưng mình muốn có kiến thức. Nên là mình đồng ý. Thời gian đầu ôn e khóc quá trời vì thấy bản thân kém quá kh theo các bạn, e tự hỏi liệu mình có lựa chọn đúng không? Vì ôn thi tốn rất nhiều thời gian và e sẽ bỏ lỡ các kiến thức trên lớp. 

E thấy mình cố chấp. Không biết từ khi nào bản thân lại tự ti và tin rằng mình yếu kém đến thế. Vốn dĩ trước đó e cũng là người học tốt cũng đạt được những thành tích cao. Nhưng khi bước sang môi trường mới, e thấm thía rằng bản thân chỉ là hạt cát, e bị áp lực đồng trang lứa. Đã có lúc e muốn vươn lên để khẳng định mình nhưng e cảm giác mình như 1 con cá đang dãy đành đạch trên nền đất vậy. 

Nhìn các bạn giỏi hơn e vừa tự nhủ bản thân phải cố, phải học hỏi. Nhưng mặt khác cũng buồn, cũng ghen. E muốn bỏ cuộc. Chắc ai cũng lo lắng cả, nhưng các bạn ai cũng toát ra sự tự tin, mọi người khẳng định chắc nịch rằng sẽ đoạt giải cao khiến e rất áp lực. E tự hỏi, sao người ta tham vọng thế? E cũng muốn bản thân tự tin lên mà dám tham vọng, dám ước mơ thâth lớn. Nhưng e cứ sợ. Bạn bè xung quanh e động viên rằng trong mặt họ e cũng rất là giỏi nên không cần phải so sánh mình với người khác. Nhưng e không ngăn được bản thân, e thấy mình kém, e thấy mình chẳng có tài cán, giỏi giang gì cả, e tự ti. 

E hay tìm 1 người lắng nghe e, nhưng thực chất là e đi tìm sự công nhận. E không công nhận bản thân e nên phải tìm nó ở người khác. Nhưng cho dù e có nhận được sự công nhận bằng lời nói của họ e vẫn không tin. 

Có người bảo e phải tin vào mình, hãy nhìn lại những thành tích mà mình đã đạt được!em cho rằng, thành tích quá khứ đó giờ đây không có nghĩa lí gì cả. 

E ngưỡng mộ đồng thời cũng bị áp lực tiêu cực. E đã cố gắng động viên mình rằng, cứ học đi, đến đâu thì đến. Nhưng nếu e học mãi mà chẳng bằng ai thì sao? Nếu e học nhưng e chẳng có gì? Nếu e thất bại e có khóc không? Em sẽ phải làm thế nào nếu như e không khẳng định được rằng bản thân có năng lực? Mọi người có nói e, nhỡ e cảm thấy xấu hổ thì sao? Nhỡ bố mẹ e thất vọng về e. 

Dù xác định mình đi ôn chỉ để lấy kiến thức, nhưng nếu tất cả mọi người đều đỗ, chỉ có 1 mình e thất bại. Thì lúc đó, e có mất hết sự lạc quan vui vẻ. E có khóc lóc trách móc bản thân mình vô dụng không. E chỉ mong rằng nếu mình có thất bại ê chề thì e vẫn không buồn, thì e vẫn tin tưởng vào bản thân vẫn có giá trị thôi chỉ là e chưa nhận ra giá trị ấy. Con người ai cũng có những giá trị riêng mà. 

Hôm nay e vẫn ôn, vẫn học nhưng e thấy hoang mang. Nếu mình lại thất bại nữa? Không giỏi cái này thì mình giỏi cái khác, nhưng ngoài cái này ra thì mình làm gì theo nổi cái nào nữa?

Có người khuyên nên nhìn vào điểm mạnh của mình, nhưng e nhìn mãi chưa thấy mình mạnh được cái gì cả. Khuyên e rằng thật ra có nhiều điều e làm được nhưng người khác chưa thể, nhưng e thấy chỉ cần người ta cố gắng 1 chút thôi là có thể vượt qua mình rồi. 

E sợ người khác khen mình chăm chỉ. E sợ mình chăm vẫn không đạt được thành tích gì. E sợ sự chăm chỉ của e là thừa thãi. Nhưng e lại chẳng có năng lực hay trí thông minh để giỏi nhanh chóng 1 cái gì như người ta. 

Nhưng e tin chuyện gì rồi cũng qua, e mong rằng bàn thân sẽ tìm ra cách để được tự do, hạnh phúc, và thoải mái trong suy nghĩ. 

E không muốn mình bị áp lực tiêu cực. 

Em muốn bản thân sống thật vui, thật hạnh phúc mà chẳng cần những thành tích, những công nhận. Em muốn phải thân phải tự tin lên, tin rằng mình có giá trị và đừng sợ hãi khi thấy người khác tự tin và tham vọng nữa, đừng áp lực quá khi thấy thành quả của người khác nữa. Có ai chết khi chẳng có thành quả gì đâu.

This case has been making a lot of noise in Vietnam for the past few days, everyone knows it. The problem is that I feel that cases related to school violence, whether by teachers or students bullying each other, are either hidden by the school or ignored. There was a case of a female student committing suicide due to excessive bullying that the school knew about but deliberately forced the female student to go to school to be bullied again, while not taking any action to handle the bullying. 

Obviously, anyone who lives in Vietnam knows that this is to maintain achievement points and the school's reputation. 

Think about what it would be like for someone who is still in school and someone whose children are still in school, either being bullied to the point of having to change schools, leaving psychological scars, while no one defends them. If there were no such evidence clips, who would know about the bullying incident? But now they even punish those who dare to speak or post clips.

What do you think about this case?","Hate to admit but I feel they tried to cover the teachers Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student.

Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. 

Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. 

Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.

And outside, good luck smoking those PM 2.5 dust particles, if you didn't know Hanoi is one of the most polluted city in the world. Everything in this place tries to kill you but slowly. Like even the food, I genuinely can't find a place to buy fresh and clean veggies due to the recent ""Winmart incident"" and I have doubt about every single restaurants 

It seems that no one actually care about your physical health being, with high humid and heat is very lethal, yet we still have PE classes outdoors at 1 PM to 3.30. And what about mental heath? sorry not sorry, it doesn't exit. 

College has been great also, just like in high school if not exactly the same, lets learn useless things, remember useless formulas so you can get an A. Maybe I am not in the 3rd or 4th year yet but as of now I just feel like I am wasting my time and effort trying to please the teachers, I have yet to gain deeper knowledge. Btw, all econ related degrees are basically useless, 80% with GPA higher than 3.2 which is WHAT?!!! 10 years ago it was much different. 

This is quite a brutal rant and maybe I am a little dramatic due to the weather but one question remains, how can I thrive in this environment?","freshman college rant about how a $$ hanoi hello dear friend , i now truly suffer place , how can people actually wanna live like ? i a vietnamese studying neu boy do suck hanoi . vietnam climate just .... bad . how can our economy grow fast quality life have more less decrease over year ? humid .. always 80 , 90 %, heat , rainy season which mold everywhere , cold again humidddd ! outside , good luck smoke those pm 2 . 5 dust particle , if you didn't know hanoi one most polluted city world . everything place try kill you slowly . like even food , i truly can't find a place buy fresh clean veggie due recent "" winmart incident "" i have doubt about every single restaurant seem no one actually care about your physical health , high humidity heat very lethal , yet we still have pe class outdoors 1 pm 3 . 30 . what about mental heat ? sorry not sorry , doesn't exit . college have great also , just like high school if not exactly same , let learn useless thing , remember useless formula you can get an a . maybe i not 3rd 4th year yet a now i just feel like i waste my time effort try please teacher , i have yet gain deep knowledge . btw , all econ relate degree basically useless , 80 % gpa high than 3 . 2 which what ?!!! 10 year ago much different . quite a brutal rant maybe i a little dramatic due weather one question remain , how can i thrive environment ?",Depression

i (23m) have never dyed my hair, nor will i ever dye my hair, and ever since a family incident, i have been even more paranoid about dyeing my hair to the point of delusion (i don't have any delusional thoughts and i know that there is no hair dye mandate anywhere in the world), and i feel like it is absolutely a delusion in my world (p.s. i am currently two meeting therapists (once each week) to vent about the frustrations i have with my family).

well to preface, not only don't i dye my hair nor have any tattoos, i usually dress up in formal white-collar attire (button down shirt/dress or khaki pants) and i have been obsessed with tech/ai/computer science and stem in general since childhood and has been a few grade levels ahead in stem subjects. i was even conferred an sb in eecs in 2022 and love to present myself as “refined and fastidious”. my favorite music genre is classical music (inherited this love from my father (75m), who studied in the ussr and czechoslovakia in the 70s before returning to vietnam to become vietnam’s fauci, and have loved classical music since early childhood). i am also liberal socially and fiscally moderate. my personality dictates that i stand very little chance of dyeing my hair, let alone an unnatural color. Despite the fact i am not into hair dyeing, i don't mind others dyeing their hair and i am completely acceptable with it. i also do understand why people dye their hair, and 99.99% of the time, they do so on their own will.

not my sister however.

i lived with her until we were 16 (2017), first in Vietnam with my parents (75m, 64f, who both never dyed their hair), then in Russia (2006-12) with my uncle-by-marriage (89m) and aunt (87f), and then the us with my oldest sister (35f). at the age of 16 (my senior year of high school), i moved out into my own studio in a college-town and same city where i attended college (where i still live today), and due to the fact i have lived with her for 16 years, i have known a lot about her personality. she is extremely studious, diligent, introverted, polite-mannered, altruistic, and has a refined taste. until the age of 14, her favorite music genre was also classical music, knew how to play the violin (i knew piano and played numerous chopin etudes/beethoven sonatas, etc) and during elementary and middle school, despite the fact she was a grade below me (same age as me), she was in a lot of honors/advanced courses. she was converted to k-pop in 2015. i lost contact with her after an altercation at around 18 due to jealousy due to family treating her better than me and viewing me as a black sheep/scapegoat, but during the 18 years of being a close friend, i have discovered one facet about her: she has no interest in dyeing her hair. i even encouraged her to dye her hair for prom and that dyeing her hair is fine, but she seemed to have no interest in it. hair dyeing is not in her nor my personality.

what incited my jealousy and altercation between my sister was my parents buying her a 1000 sqft single house for 500k in 2019 (heard through a whistleblower, who was my close friend) and later a 1000 sqft condo for 800k in the poshest neighborhood in 2021. my parents paid 50% of my $1500 per month (at the time) rent between 2017 and 2021, when i sacked them because my investments have gathered from the 5 figures (using my internship and mobile app money from 2018) into the 7 figures due to tesla, faang, and others over the pandemic. my oldest sister owned my bank account in july 2019 and drained 5000 usd of my own money (luckily, the other 50k are in my apartment’s safe) from the bank and gave it to my other sister just to buy her a 45k 2019 bmw 330xi rather than a toyota camry. by this point, she has not made any money yet and had 8 years of work experience, mostly volunteer work. In 2023, upon graduating college, they upgraded her to a Porsche Taycan. Meanwhile, i purchased a 25k used 2021 tesla model 3 last june for 25k using my own money from sw consulting and upgraded from a 225k mi 2016 toyota rav4 to save up for an ai startup.

Fast forward to 2020:

Due to the fact my sister is “short” on money (according to my parents, despite them giving 5-6 figures to her every year for food, gas, and essentials), she charged $500 per month for her best friend at college (Cantonese) to live with her as a roommate (she knew of this “friend” since high school in 2017 which motivated her to attend the college). This was during the first month of COVID, when her roommate was evicted from dorm.

Fast forward a few more months into late 2020, my parents communicated with me stating that my sister was coerced into dyeing her hair brown. Her slightly older roommate started dyeing her hair in 2017 (according to my parents). She had no interest in dyeing her hair until then, but she now did, and my parents were kinda discombobulated with this decision as there was no indication she was going to dye her hair.

Then in December 2020, my state started rolling out vaccines (by this time, Vietnam was nowhere near approving any vaccines), and announced that in April 2021, everyone ages 16+ will be eligible for vaccines. Vietnam hadn’t even started any vaccine roll out schedule until about March and from June to September 2021, only the non-FDA vaccines were available (that meant in December 2020, we are not even sure if Vietnamese civilians would even get vaccines in 2021 or not, let alone the Pfizer/Moderna ones). Due to this, my parents have warned my sister to refrain entering Vietnam, due to the risk of COVID, despite the fact the COVID risk was low in 2020 in Vietnam. That was because if the US gets vaccinated in May and none of Vietnam gets vaccinated, my parents (with my father being the President of Vietnam’s DAV and regarded as the Vietnamese Fauci) predicted that the tides will change and the US will become lower-risk during the medium term.

Despite my parents’ and the CDC’s advice, my sister still took the plunge and visited Vietnam knowing that the risk of not getting the best vaccines and being denied entry is on the stakes (she got a green card in 2021, 5 years after me). In case you didn’t know, Phi Nhung, a healthy Vietnamese American idol, died in 2021 due to COVID in Vietnam, and if she stayed in the US, she would have been alive. She booked the tickets in late December, stayed at trai cach ly (many people regarded it as a prison), and arrived around Tet.

Not only did she have poor judgement in arriving in Vietnam in early 2021, she also transferred to a podunk for-profit school which has low job placement rates and high drop out rates (my older cousin dropped out from a similar school in another state after 6 years and 6 years worth of credits without even a bachelor’s degree despite having taken over 128 credits with 250k in debt). My parents urged her to transfer to a semi-prestigious university like BU, NYU, UCSD, UT Austin, UW Seattle, etc, after receiving a 4.0 GPA and acceptance to BU, NYU, and UCSD, stating they will pay the tuition in full but she instead opted for the for profit route.

Due to the fact my parents were infuriated about the roommate and the fact my sister is friends with her (my parents thought she was a terrible influence and that the roommate got my sister to start vaping and making weird noises on camera like an autistic), they advised her to cut ties and they even started to evict the roommate in April 2021 and sold off the house and transferred that equity into an 800k condo closer to school. She lived there alone since 2021 (according to my parents, and I am not even sure of the address).

In the two years since dyeing her hair, she has allowed her roots to grow out (according to pictures) and since 2022, she has kept her hair black, with no intentions of ever dyeing her hair. My parents still have black hair despite their advanced age and none has dyed their hair or has any intention of doing so. My parents told me she sacked all communication with her friend since getting her first full time job in early 2022. My sister even ignored all travel advisories and visited Saint Petersburg Russia in Summer of 2022 on her 3 week trip to Europe which consists of Budapest, Bratislava, Vienna, Prague, Krakow, Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg.

TL;DR: The reason why I am so paranoid about dyeing my hair is due to the fact I am going to Vietnam for Tet (my first Tet celebration in Vietnam since 2006, when I was 52 months), and this heavily resonates to the time my sister went to Vietnam in 2021 for Tet (her first time since 2006 as well). To “save” money for my tech startup whilst also getting a modern apartment which includes a business lounge, I was also looking for apartments in a suburb she used to live when dyeing her hair and which her roommate still purportedly lives (fun fact: I saw her at a Chinese supermarket in that suburb months ago and hence, I still believes she lives there).
